<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

In New Relic Insights, you can export data (maximum of [1,000 results per NRQL query](#api)) from any [table chart](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table) to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. You can then use the `.csv` file in other applications, such as Microsoft Excel.

## Rules for CSV data [#file-contents]

Before downloading CSV data for Insights [table charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table), be aware of the following:

* CSV files can only be generated for [table charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table).
* For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, `since 30 minutes ago`), CSV data is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. This means that a delay between chart load and the CSV file generation could result in data differences.
* The query string must be shorter than 3 KB to export to CSV.

The exported CSV data follows these rules in the query or chart:

* Insights [filters](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/filter-insights-dashboards): If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter.
* Selected time range: If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV file includes the data for that time period.
* FACET queries: If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query.

## Export table to .CSV file [#export-csv]

To generate a CSV file from a dashboard [table chart](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table): From a dashboard's [table chart](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table), select <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
, and select the **CSV** button.

To generate a CSV from a NRQL query: Run a query with the [query tool](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql#command-line-query). If the resulting chart is a [table chart](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table), select the **CSV** button.

## Use API to retrieve data [#api]

You can also use the [Insights query API](/docs/insights/insights-api/get-data/query-insights-event-data-api) to retrieve data. The API helps you get around the 1,000 result limit by querying in 1,000 result chunks.
