  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).

Insights has three levels of permissions for your dashboards, controlling how visible and editable they are.

## Permission levels [#permissions]

The dashboard permissions are:

* **Private to just me**: If you created the dashboard, you're the only one who can view and edit it. This is the most secure option.
* **Visible to others in my account**: Everyone can view the dashboard, but only you can edit it.
* **Editable by others in my account** (default): Everyone can edit the dashboard. This includes deleting it.

This table describes user roles as they relate to dashboard permissions. For more information, see:

* [Add-on roles and permissions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/add-roles-permissions)
* [Permissions for deleting dashboards](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/delete-dashboards-charts)
