<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).

The refresh rate of UI charts is the range of the query's timeframe divided by 60. The maximum frequency with which queries can be refreshed is every 5 seconds. This applies to [Insights](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights), [dashboards in New Relic One](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), and [chart builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).

For example:

* A query with a 7-day time range would have a refresh rate of once every 2.8 hours.
* A query with a 1-hour time range would have a refresh rate of once every 1 minute.

For `TIMESERIES` queries, the widget uses the size of the `TIMESERIES` bucket as the refresh interval. For example:

* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 5 minutes` would refresh every 5 minutes.
* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 1 hour SINCE 1 day ago` would refresh every hour.
