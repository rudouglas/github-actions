  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).

If your company uses multiple New Relic accounts across teams, you can add charts to other account dashboards for a more complete understanding of your company's data.

## Requirements and permissions [#requirements]

In order to add a chart to another account you must:

* Ensure the target dashboard is set to **Editable by others in my account**.
* Be a registered user on the target account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can [add users via the UI](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/add-update-users) or [via the partnership user API call](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object).
</Callout>

Users in the target account can:

* View the query (if dashboard is set to **Viewable by others**).
* View and edit the query (if dashboard is set to **Editable by others in my account**).

If the user viewing the target dashboard is not registered as a user in the source account, the chart does not load.

## Add a chart to another account's dashboard [#add]

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also select the source account from the account switcher in the query tool to query the source account's data and copy the resulting chart to a dashboard.
</Callout>

To add a chart to another account's dashboard:

1. Ensure the [requirements](#requirements) are met.
2. Run your NRQL query, copy an existing chart, or select **Add to an Insights dashboard** under an existing UI chart.
3. From the **Copy chart** modal, select the account dropdown at the top.
4. Search for and select the target account's dashboard where you want to add your chart.
5. Select **Copy**.
