<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

New Relic's Insights **Query** page is one place you can run [NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) of your data. Use the **Query** page to:

* Create and run queries of your data.
* View your query history.
* View favorite queries.
* Use the NRQL query to create, view, organize, and share Insights dashboards.

## Use NRQL query history [#history]

To view up to twenty of your most recent queries, select the **History** tab directly below the query command line interface. Use the query history to adjust and improve recent queries.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **If you want to...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Do this...**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Run recent queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Select a recent query from the history list. The query will appear on the command line, where it can be edited.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Delete queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over a query in the history list so the delete <Icon name="fe-trash-2"/>
        icon appears. The query history only retains the twenty most recent queries, so it can be useful to delete unwanted queries to make room for queries you like.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Favorite queries
      </td>

      <td>
        Mouse over a query in the history list and the favorite <Icon name="fe-star"/>
        icon appears. Then, to view and use your favorite queries, select the **Favorites** tab.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
