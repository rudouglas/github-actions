<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like `JOIN` function for subqueries. **Recommendation:** Make the [transition from Insights to New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights) so that you can take advantage of [nested queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/nested-aggregation-make-ordered-computations-single-query).

## Simulate SQL `JOIN` in Insights [#join-custom-attributes]

If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add [custom attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-data-insights) to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a `JOIN` by using custom attributes in a query's `WHERE` or `FACET` clause.

**Example:** You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named `Product` to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query:

```
SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) 
FROM PageView 
WHERE Product = 'Hat' 
FACET userAgentName 
SINCE 7 days ago
```
