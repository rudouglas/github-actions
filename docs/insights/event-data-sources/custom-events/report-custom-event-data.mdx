<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).

New Relic products report [a variety of default event data](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data) to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes.

## Value from custom events and attributes

Event data is one of the [fundamental New Relic data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types). Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events.

By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized [queries and charts of your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you.

## Avoid rate limits [#rate-limits]

Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals.

Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data:

* Ensure you follow [limits and requirements](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/data-requirements) around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size.
* The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your [data retention policy](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/insights-data-retention).

## Send custom events and attributes [#ways]

Methods for sending custom events and attributes include:

## Extend data retention [#data-retention]

To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about [event data retention](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/insights-data-retention).
