APM's web transactions analysis report provides comparison information for web transactions, including the amount of time spent in throughput (requests per minute or **rpm**), total time in the web transaction, average time to execute it, and [Apdex](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) score. You can compare the past 24 hours of data with the previous 24 hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days.

Use this information to analyze which web transactions consume the most time, have the most number of calls, have the greatest number of standard deviations, and more. This information can help you identify where to fine-tune your app.
