APM's database analysis report allows you to analyze your application's performance from the database viewpoint, from the past 24 hours back to the past seven days. It shows comparison information for transactions, including the amount of time spent in throughput (operation requests per minute or **rpm**), total time spent in the operation, and average time to execute it.

## View the database analysis report [#procedures]

To view the database analysis report for your app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Reports > Database**. The default report compares the last 24 hours with the previous 24-hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days.
