APM's scalability analysis report shows response time, database utilization, and CPU utilization compared to app load as scatter plot charts. This helps you analyze performance and potential hardware needs as your app grows.

## View the Scalability analysis report [#procedures]

To view the report for your app:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Reports > Scalability**.
2. From the **Scalability analysis** page, select the tab to view scatter plot charts for **Response time**, **Database**, or **CPU**.
3. From the individual chart tab, select the [time period](#time).
4. Select or clear the **Filter outliers** checkbox.
5. Use any of New Relic's standard [page functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/standard-dashboard-features) to drill down into detailed information.

The scalability analysis report includes three charts.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Scalability chart**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Response time
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart plots your application's response time in milliseconds, versus application load in terms of requests per minute. For an application that is scaling well, the response time should be at or close to horizontal.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Database utilization
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart plots your application's database utilization versus application load in terms of requests per minute. For an application that is scaling well, you should see a roughly linear pattern in the plotted points
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        CPU utilization
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart plots your application's CPU time per request for the Rails process, versus application load in terms of requests per minute. For an application that is scaling well, you should see a roughly linear pattern in the plotted points.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Select options for time periods [#time]

Each scalability analysis report includes options to view the data for different time periods, including the last 24 hours, last 7 days, or other. For example, if you select **Use time window selection** and the [time picker](/docs/site/timepicker-setting-time-periods-to-view-data) uses the default value (last 30 minutes, ending now), the chart shows only the data for the last 30 minutes.

## Analyze your data [#insights]

APM includes several reports in the user interface. To gather, analyze, and visualize data about your software in other formats, use [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).
