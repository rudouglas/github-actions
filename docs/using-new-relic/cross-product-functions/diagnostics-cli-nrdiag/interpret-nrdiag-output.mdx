## File output

The Diagnostics CLI outputs three files:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Diagnostics output files
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.zip`
      </td>

      <td>
        A flattened folder structure with one or more config files and any existing New Relic logs. Attach this file to support tickets. This archive also contains a copy of `nrdiag-output.json`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.json`
      </td>

      <td>
        Output of the individual tests. Attach this output to tickets.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-filelist.txt`
      </td>

      <td>
        A list of files found. The `nrdiag-output.zip` file that you attach to support tickets automatically includes this list. You do not need to attach this `.txt` file separately.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
