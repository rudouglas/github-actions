New Relic Mobile is compliant with standard application stores, including Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and others. Before you [install and configure](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/tvos/tvos-installation-configuration) New Relic Mobile functionality with your mobile applications, make sure your tvOS app meets these requirements for New Relic Mobile.

## Foreground monitoring [#foreground]

As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/data-security), New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. For more information, see our [Mobile data privacy and security documentation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/get-started/security-mobile-apps).

## tvOS requirements [#requirements]
