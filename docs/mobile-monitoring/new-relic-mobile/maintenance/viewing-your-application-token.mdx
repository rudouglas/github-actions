New Relic's mobile monitoring automatically assigns a unique, 40-character hexadecimal string to each mobile app you monitor, for both the US and EU datacenter. This application token is similar to a New Relic license key and is required to authenticate your app's data.

To view your application token:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), click **Mobile**, and select a monitored app.
2. Select **Application** or **Installation**.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Data reported from your mobile app is tied to a named app based on the application token. All apps with a single application token will report to the same place in our mobile monitoring UI, regardless of the app's name when installed on a mobile device. We recommend using a different application token for each platform to separate iOS and Android versions.
