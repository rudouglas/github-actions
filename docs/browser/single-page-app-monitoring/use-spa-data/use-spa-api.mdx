Browser's single-page application (SPA) monitoring includes an API to add custom monitoring of specific browser interactions. This is useful for monitoring interactions that New Relic does not record automatically because they do not result in route changes, such as a dynamically-updated widget. The SPA API also allows you to turn off default monitoring for interactions that you do not consider important enough to monitor.

For more information about the SPA API, including specific API calls, see the [Browser agent and SPA API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api).
