In the New Relic UI, you can enable [single-page app (SPA) monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/introduction-single-page-app-monitoring).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To use SPA and browser monitoring, as well as the rest of our [observability platform](https://one.newrelic.com), join the New Relic family! [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup) to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever.

## Prerequisites [#prerequites]

In order to deploy SPA monitoring, you must:

* Make sure your app and Browser agent version meet New Relic's [compatibility and requirements](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/spa-compatibility-requirements).
* Agree to the Terms of Service, which automatically appears during the setup process for the first app you select for your account. By agreeing to the Terms, you authorize New Relic to collect hash fragments from URLs. You only need to select the checkbox option once for your account.

## Enable SPA monitoring [#enable-spa]

To deploy SPA monitoring for your app, you must already have a **Pro** subscription. Then, you must enable **Pro + SPA** monitoring, and deploy a new JavaScript snippet that includes SPA monitoring.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The bottom of the generated JavaScript snippet includes your Browser license key and application ID. This is useful, for example, when using the New Relic REST API (v2) or API Explorer.
</Callout>

To enable SPA monitoring:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**, then select **Pro + SPA**.
2. Agree to the Terms of Service.
3. Select **Save application settings**.
4. Deploy the new JavaScript snippet using the same method you used when you [originally deployed Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/adding-apps-new-relic-browser) for your app:

   * If you deploy Browser with the copy/paste method: Copy the entire JavaScript code snippet. Paste it as close to the top of the `HEAD` of your webpage as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (for example, `X-UA-Compatible` or `charset` information).
   * If you deploy using an APM agent: If possible, restart your app and clear the server-side cache to ensure the APM agent picks up the change and deploys the new JavaScript snippet.
5. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for Browser to start receiving SPA monitoring data.

To view SPA data: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Page views**. If SPA data does not start to appear in the [**Page views** page](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/browser-ui/view-spa-data-new-relic-browser) after a few minutes, see Browser's [troubleshooting procedures](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/troubleshooting).

## Disable SPA monitoring [#opt-out]

To opt out of our SPA monitoring feature:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**.
2. Select a different agent version/loader option.
3. Select **Save application settings**.
