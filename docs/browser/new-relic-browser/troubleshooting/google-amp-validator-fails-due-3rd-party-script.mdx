## Problem

The [Google AMP validator](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/validate) fails when you include the Browser agent in HTML pages formatted for [Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project](https://www.ampproject.org/).

For example, you may see a validation error that says:

```
The tag 'script' is disallowed except in specific forms.
```

## Solution

To successfully validate your AMP pages and avoid the error message, set the following for your AMP pages:

* Enable the [Browser monitoring for AMP](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/monitor-amp-pages-new-relic-browser) on your AMP pages.
* Disable the [Browser monitoring agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/disable-browser-monitoring-specific-pages) on your AMP pages.

This ensures that AMP pages validate successfully and that the Browser agent continues to monitor your non-AMP pages.

## Cause

According to the [AMP spec](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/spec), HTML pages formatted for the AMP project are not allowed to contain any author-written or third-party JavaScript. By default, the Browser agent will be included in any pages served by your application, including the pages which are intended only for consumption by the AMP webcrawler.
