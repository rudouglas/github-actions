You can validate the success of your cloud migration by comparing the baselines of your on-premise applications against the baselines of your migrated cloud applications.

As you complete each milestone in your cloud migration, compare the baselines of your applications against their previous baselines. For the final acceptance test at the end of your migrations, compare the on-premise baselines against the final migrated cloud baselines. Follow the steps in this doc to determine if your migration was successful or if you still have some work to do before it is complete.

## 1. Gather existing on-premise baselines [#on-premise-baselines]

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic recommends [creating application baselines](/docs/create-application-baselines) before continuing this procedure.
</Callout>

As part of [creating application baselines](/docs/create-application-baselines), you identified application components to move to the cloud, deployed New Relic, and recorded baselines for your applications based on existing on-premise deployment. You can reuse the same table that you created in the [application baseline](/docs/create-application-baselines) tutorial for your on-premise baselines:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colSpan={4}>
        Example of a baseline before cloud migration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Component Name**
      </td>

      <td>
        **[Response time](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/response-time)**
      </td>

      <td>
        **[Availability (SLA)](/docs/apm/reports/other-performance-analysis/availability-report)**
      </td>

      <td>
        **[Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)**
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Service 1
      </td>

      <td>
        1.5 secs
      </td>

      <td>
        80%
      </td>

      <td>
        70%
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Service 2
      </td>

      <td>
        0.7 secs
      </td>

      <td>
        73%
      </td>

      <td>
        68%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## 2. Compare baselines after you migrate [#compare-baselines]

Establish milestones as you progress with your cloud migration by reviewing baselines for applications, databases, and other application tiers. After you migrate an application to the cloud, repeat the same steps that you used to [create an on-premise baseline](/docs/create-application-baselines) until you have migrated all components to the cloud (applications, web services, databases, message queues). You can mark application baselines based on time (for example, bi-weekly) or based on the full migration of each application tier.

Build on your [on-premise baseline table](#on-premise-baselines) to compare results after each migration milestone:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colSpan={4}>
        Example of a baseline after cloud migration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Component Name**
      </td>

      <td>
        **[Response time](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/response-time)**
      </td>

      <td>
        **[Availability (SLA)](/docs/apm/reports/other-performance-analysis/availability-report)**
      </td>

      <td>
        **[Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)**
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Service 1
      </td>

      <td>
        0.9 secs
      </td>

      <td>
        96.8%
      </td>

      <td>
        95%
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Service 2
      </td>

      <td>
        0.6 secs
      </td>

      <td>
        90%
      </td>

      <td>
        92%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can see the most benefit from the **Availability** metric by monitoring it over a long period of time. However, as you move closer to completing your migration, this metric should get closer and closer to 100%.
</Callout>

## 3. Create dashboards to track migration results [#create-dashboards]

Use [dashboard charts](/docs/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/manage-your-dashboard) to track each of your [business key performance indicator (KPI)](/docs/create-application-baselines#gather-metrics) so that you can measure the success of your cloud migration.

This dashboard illustrates the maturity of your applicationâ€™s performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones:

![migration_image.png](./images/migration_image.png "migration_image.png")

At the end of your migration, you can display this information in [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) to show a clear comparison between your on-premise environment and your migrated cloud environment.

## 4. Uncover issues [#uncover-issues]

New Relic provides performance metrics, but it also provides errors and unhandled exceptions associated with your applications. It is important to keep an eye on errors and exceptions so you can verify if they occur before, during, or after your migration. Refer to [Identify issues and roadblocks](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/plan-your-cloud-adoption-strategy/identify-issues-roadblocks) for more detail regarding the detection of errors or possible issues with your application's architecture, scale, or performance.

## Expert tip for ensuring a successful migration [#monitor-migrate]

Continue to compare baselines until you have successfully migrated all components of your application to the cloud. The goal is to have your cloud-based application baselines perform as well as, or better than, their on-premise baselines. You may not be able to draw 1:1 comparisons between your cloud-based components and their on-premise counterparts, but you will be able to compare established cloud migration milestones throughout your migration to make sure it is successful.
