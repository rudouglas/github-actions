This document describes some best practices and examples to help you get the most out of your alerts configuration.

<Callout variant="important">
  Before reading this, we recommend you read [Alerts concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow).
</Callout>

## Define policies for entities or people [#entities-people]

When designing your policies, consider:

* The parts of your architecture that need personnel to be responsible for them
* The individuals who are responsible for one or more parts of your infrastructure

An organization may have multiple entities monitored by APM, Browser, Infrastructure, and Synthetic. Examples of considerations for different teams:

* **Software developers** may need [notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts) for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors.
* **Operations personnel** may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages.
* **The product owner** may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards).

By following these best practices, key personnel will receive actionable notifications for the metrics that matter to them, and overall, the organization will be able to identify and respond to trends or patterns more efficiently.

## Control how many notifications you get [#more-or-less]

The more [conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) you define, the more [incidents](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history) can be triggered and monitored. For example, your organization may need an alerting solution to accommodate extensive IT systems. Create policies with multiple conditions for [multiple monitored entities](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition) that notify you through one or more notification channels. Set [incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents) to determine how violations lead to notifications.

On the other hand, your organization may not need an extensive alerting structure. The fewer conditions you define and the more minimal your incident preference is, the fewer violations will be opened. For example, for a simple alerting solution, you could create a simple policy with only an email [notification channel](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts).

## Set thresholds for conditions [#conditions]

Set the [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) for your policy's conditions to meaningful levels for your environment. Here are some suggested guidelines:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Action
      </th>

      <th>
        **Recommendations**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Set threshold levels
      </td>

      <td>
        **Avoid setting thresholds too low.** For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Experimenting with settings
      </td>

      <td>
        **You do not need to edit files or restart software**, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Adjust settings
      </td>

      <td>
        **Adjust your conditions over time.**

        * As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance.
        * If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Disable settings
      </td>

      <td>
        You can **disable any condition** in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded [health status indicator](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#health-status) in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it.

For example, you can define a critical (red) threshold that notifies you when the error percentage for your app is above 10 percent at least once in any five minute period. You can also define an optional warning (yellow) threshold with different criteria.

## Select notification channels [#channels]

You can create [notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts) first and then assign policies to them. You can also create policies first and then assign notification channels to them. This flexibility allows you to tailor who gets notified, using the method that is most useful to them.

For example, you could:

* Identify your operations team's Slack channel as a general level of alerting, and use the on-call PagerDuty contact as an after-hours or escalated level of alerting.
* Create webhooks with customized messages for a variety of situations or personnel.

<Callout variant="tip">
  By tailoring notifications to the most useful channel and policy, you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way.
