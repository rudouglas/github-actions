title: archive Locate exact metric names
metaDescription: Use the Custom Dashboard editor or the API Explorer to retrieve exact metric names for New Relic products.
---

You must know the exact metric name to [alert on a metric](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-custom-metrics-alert-condition). You can find metric names from the [Insights Metric Explorer](#metric-explorer) or the [REST API Explorer](#via-rest-api).

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic's REST API Explorer may find metrics that do not provide meaningful data. For better results, use [Insights Metric Explorer](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/explore/metric-data-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents) to verify that there is meaningful data associated with your metric before using it.
</Callout>

## Use Insights Metric Explorer (recommended) [#metric-explorer]

New Relic recommends using the [Metric Explorer](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/explore/metric-data-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents) in Insights to:

* Search all your metric data, including custom metrics
* Create customizable metric charts
* Add metric charts to Insights dashboards

To use the Metric Explorer to get the exact name for a metric:

1. Go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Data Explorer > Metrics**.
2. Search for and select a metric.
3. Under the metric chart, select **View in API Explorer**.
4. On the API Explorer page for that metric, copy the name from the **names\[]** field.

## Use the API Explorer (advanced) [#via-rest-api]

You can use the REST API Explorer to return a list of all metrics for your app, server, or plugin. Seeing all available metrics can make it easier to create plans for making use of those metrics.

<Callout variant="important">
  You must provide your [REST API key or an Admin user's API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/api-keys) in order to use the API Explorer. If your API key does not auto-populate in New Relic's API Explorer, make sure you selected your account from the **Select an account** dropdown.

  OR

  [Manually retrieve](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key) your API key.
</Callout>

1. Go to the API Explorer at **[rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore)**.
2. Select an account and key from the **account and key** dropdown.
3. Select **GET Metric Names**, and then specify your target [product ID](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id) in the **application_id** (or **component_id**, **server_id**, etc.) field. Select **Send Request**.
4. From the API Explorer's returned JSON response, browse the metric names associated with the `"name":` key to locate the target metric.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also take the cURL commands generated by the API Explorer and paste them into a terminal window for local output.
