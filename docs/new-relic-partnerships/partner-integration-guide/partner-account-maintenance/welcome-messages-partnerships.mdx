These settings are controlled by New Relic. If you want to use this feature, please coordinate with the technical contact for your New Relic partnership.

## Multiple sub-partnerships [#multiple-names]

If your partnership does business under multiple names or in multiple different marketplaces using different branding, you can distinctively brand the different partnerships. This functionality is available using multiple sub-partnerships under a single partnership owner account. The partnerships can be distinct with several settings, including:

* Name
* Product pricing
* Branding (headers, footers, etc.)
* Billing configuration

After you log into your partnership owner account, you can select from the list of sub-partnership accounts.
