  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of [December 2, 2020](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832), plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-plugin-eol-wednesday-june-16th-2021/127267).

## Requirements

If you want to use New Relic's [REST API (v2)](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) or the [API Explorer](/docs/apm/apis/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer) user interface to get plugin data, you need:

* Your [REST API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key)
* The [product identification code](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/finding-product-id) for your `{PLUGIN_ID}` or `{COMPONENT_ID}`
* Other values as appropriate for your cURL command or API Explorer (v2) request

If you do not know the `{PLUGIN_ID}` or `{COMPONENT_ID}`, you can use the REST API (v2) or API Explorer to [list each plugin](/docs/apm/apis/plugin-examples-v2/getting-list-plugins-api-v2), including its ID, name, GUID, summary metrics, and additional details for each component.
