<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

## Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]

As of [December 2, 2020](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832), plugin access has been limited to accounts that have accessed a legacy plugin in the past 30 days. The legacy plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) as of June 16, 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-plugin-eol-wednesday-june-16th-2021/127267).

## Collect plugin metrics [#plugin_function]

If you are running one of our APM agents to receive information about your applications, you can also receive arbitrary custom metrics. Using custom dashboards with your plugins, you can visualize custom metrics in a variety of useful ways.

You can write plugins agents that can be run anywhere to collect metrics from any available system and report them to New Relic for dashboard display. Plugins also allow for summary metrics and one or more dashboards to visualize metrics that can be shared with every user of the plugin. This allows you to create a consistent user interface for the metrics you collect.

The data that plugins report is in the form of a key/value pair. Values are numerical, either integers or floating point non-negative numbers. Negative numbers can be included in your summary metrics and tables; however, visualization in charts is limited to numbers greater than or equal to zero. Keys are strings which include the concept of name spaces and units. While values cannot be strings, parts of your metric name (the key) can be displayed in plugin dashboards.

Your plugin agent can run anywhere with internet access to Plugins. You can write an agent using the agent SDKs. You can also write your agent to connect via HTTP POST using the API for Plugins in any language with HTTP support.

Using the Plugin API might be the most appropriate solution when one agent is reporting metrics for more than one New Relic account. This is common for service providers to report specialized metrics for each of their customers using Plugins. This can be done with a small number of agents monitoring a large number of users.

## Present plugin metrics [#plugin_authoring]

When creating a plugin agent, good metric name planning is critical to your success. Poorly chosen metrics names can make it difficult or impossible to display the information you intend. Plan ahead for how you want to visualize your information and to record metrics in a way that will facilitate this. You may even want to record the same metrics with more than one name in order to visualize different aspects of your data.

Plugin dashboards do not have the ability to do mathematical calculations, so make sure your plugin agent handles any necessary calculations (sum, average, total, count, etc.) before recording metrics.

Once you have collected metrics with your plugin agent, you will need to create dashboards to visualize the information in your metrics. All plugins will have a default dashboard. You can add as many dashboards as necessary to visualize your metric data (maximum 15).

In addition to dashboards, you can choose up to five metrics to represent the summary of each instance. Summary metrics convey the health status of each instance and are used to trigger **Caution** events and **Critical** alerts for your plugins. The summary metrics appear on your plugin's **Summary** page.
