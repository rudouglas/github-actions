The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to [add the dependencies](/docs/logs/enable-logs/logs-context-java/java-configure-java-util-logging#enable-logs-javautil) to Maven's `pom.xml` or Gradle's `build.gradle`. This allows the packaging tools pick up the correct dependencies.

If you are unable to modify the application and repackage it, you can still set up logs-in-context by making some additions to your classpath.

## Classpath prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Before you modify the classpath:

* You must know the logging framework the application is using.
* You must be able to configure the logging framework because the logs-in-context configuration requires changes to your logging configuration.

## Classpath additions [#classpath_additions]

Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central.

* [Group ID (`com.newrelic.logging`) and Artifact ID (Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.newrelic.logging)
* [Group ID (`com.fasterxml.jackson.core)` and Artifact ID (`jackson-core`)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.fasterxml.jackson.core%20a:jackson-core)
* [Group ID (`com.newrelic.agent.java)` and Artifact ID (`newrelic-api`)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.newrelic.agent.java%20a:newrelic-api)
