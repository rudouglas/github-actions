Logs in context for the Python agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic, giving full context to high-level events, as well as providing high value data to specific log lines. Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To use log monitoring with the Python agent, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* Python agent 5.4.0 or higher: [Install](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/standard-python-agent-install) or [update](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/update-python-agent)

## Configure logs in context with log management [#configure-logs]

To configure New Relic logs in context with Python:

1. [Enable log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs).
2. [Install or update the Python agent](#python-plugin).
3. [Configure the Python logging framework to use the NewRelicContextFormatter](#configure-logging).
4. [Check for logging data.](#test-extension-python)

## Enable log management [#enable-logs]

Confirm that you have [log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) enabled, with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs) installed to send your application logs to New Relic.

## Install or update the Python agent [#python-plugin]

[Install](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/standard-python-agent-install) or [update](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/update-python-agent) to the most recent Python agent version, and [enable distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing).

## Configure the `NewRelicContextFormatter` [#configure-logging]

Enabling logs in Python is as simple as instantiating a log formatter and adding it to your log handler. This example uses a `StreamHandler` which by default writes logs to `sys.stderr`, but any handler can be used. See the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html) for information about configuring log handlers.

```
# Import the logging module and the New Relic log formatter
import logging
from newrelic.agent import NewRelicContextFormatter

# Instantiate a new log handler
handler = logging.StreamHandler()

# Instantiate the log formatter and add it to the log handler
formatter = NewRelicContextFormatter()
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Get the root logger and add the handler to it
root_logger = logging.getLogger()
root_logger.addHandler(handler)
```

## Check for logging data [#test-extension-python]

To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following:

1. Includes `trace.id` and `span.id` fields
2. Is properly-formatted JSON lines

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) using the [query operator](/docs/new-relic-logs-query-syntax) `has: span.id/trace.id`

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Troubleshoot errors with [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).
