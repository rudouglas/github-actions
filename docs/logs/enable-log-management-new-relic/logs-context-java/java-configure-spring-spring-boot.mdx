New Relic offers extensions for [log management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) that are compatible with current versions of [Spring](https://spring.io/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). If you use Spring, read on to learn how to enable New Relic's [logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-logs/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents) and enrich your log data.

If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation:

* [logback](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/configure-logs-context/java-configure-logback)
* [log4j 2](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/logs-context-java/java-configure-log4j-2x)
* [log4j 1](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/logs-context-java/java-configure-log4j-1x)
* [java.util.logging](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/logs-context-java/java-configure-java-util-logging)

## Compatibility and requirements [#requirements]

To use New Relic logs in context with Logback, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* New Relic Java agent 5.6.0 or higher: [install](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent) or [update](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent).

## With Spring Boot

The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher.

For users of Spring Boot, here are tips for determining which logging library you have:

* If you have `spring-boot-starter-log4j2` in your dependencies, you're using **log4j 2.x**. Refer to the [Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-configure-log4j-for-logging) for basic configuration, and the [New Relic log4j 2 extension](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/logs-context-java/java-configure-log4j-2x) for customizing configuration for New Relic Logs.
* If you're using Spring Boot but **not** the starter-log4j2, you're using **logback** by default. Refer to [Spring Boot logback documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-configure-logback-for-logging) for basic configuration, and the [New Relic logback extension](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/configure-logs-context/java-configure-logback) for customizing it for New Relic Logs.

## With Spring (but not Spring Boot) [#without-spring-boot]

Spring 5 or higher:

* Spring implements a [bridge](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory.html) to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. Consult your [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/viewing_debugging_dependencies.html), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/resolving-conflicts-using-the-dependency-tree.html), or other build tool's dependency tree to identify your logging dependency. Then visit the [individual library page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/logs-context-java/configure-logs-context-java) for more information.

Spring 4 or lower:

* Spring version 4 and lower uses [Apache Commons Logging](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/guide.html) for its bridge. Refer to the [Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.12.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/overview.html#overview-logging) for information on configuring its bridge.
