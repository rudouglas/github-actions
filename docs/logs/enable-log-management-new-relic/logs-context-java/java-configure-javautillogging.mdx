New Relic offers a [java.util.logging](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html "Link opens in a new window.") extension for [log management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs), allowing you link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This document explains how to configure logs in context and start getting log data. The [code](https://github.com/newrelic/java-log-extensions/tree/main/jul) and an [example application](https://github.com/newrelic/java-log-extensions/tree/main/examples/jul-app) are available on GitHub.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements-java-util]

To use New Relic logs in context with java.util.logging, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* Java agent 5.6.0 or higher: [Install](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent)
* JVM argument [`-javaagent`](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/include-java-agent-jvm-argument) enabled on the Java agent.
* [java.util.logging](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html) package configured and working on the application.

## Configure logs in context with log management [#configure-logs]

To configure New Relic logs in context with java-util-logging:

1. [Enable log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs).
2. [Install or update the Java agent](#java-extension).
3. [Configure the java.util.logging extension](#enable-logs-javautil).
4. [Check for logging data.](#test-extension-java)

## Enable log management [#enable-logs]

Confirm that you have [log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) enabled, with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs) installed to send your application logs to New Relic.

## Install or update the Java agent [#java-extension]

[Install](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent) to the most recent Java agent version, and [enable Distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing).

## Configure the java.util.logging extension [#enable-logs-javautil]

To configure logs in context with the java.util.logging extension, complete the following steps:

1. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable:

   * To update with Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

     ```
     dependencies {
         compile("com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0")
     }
     ```
   * To update with Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

     ```
     <dependencies>
         <dependency>
             <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId>
             <artifactId>jul</artifactId>
             <version>2.0</version>
         </dependency>
     </dependencies>
     ```

     <Callout variant="tip">
       Can't edit these files? You can [add the jars directly to the application classpath](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/logs-context-java/java-adding-classpath).
     </Callout>
2. Use the `NewRelicMemoryHandler` to intercept messages destined for another handler. Your file will have a handlers property, but it might be set to something else. Your logging properties file will include a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this:

   ```
   handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler
   ```
3. Update your logging properties file set the root logger's handler.

   ```
   handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler
   ```
4. Configure the `NewRelicMemoryHandler` by setting the target to the handler that was previously set for the handlers property. The value of this property should be the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger.

   ```
   com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler
   ```

   <Callout variant="tip">
     _Why?_ The New Relic log format includes data from the New Relic agent that must be captured on the thread the log message is coming from. This `MemoryHandler` implementation intercepts that data.
   </Callout>
5. Use a `NewRelicFormatter` for the final handler.

   Update your logging properties file to set the `formatter` property like the example below. **Note:** the handler on which you set the formatter must be the `target` handler from the previous step (`java.util.logging.FileHandler` in this example).

   ```
   java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicFormatter
   ```

   <Callout variant="tip">
     _Why?_ The New Relic log format is a tailored JSON format with specific fields in specific places that our log forwarder plugins and back end rely on. At this time, we don't support any customization of that format.
   </Callout>

   <Callout variant="tip">
     Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like`log.level` and `thread.name`. The `trace.id`, which is required for Logs in Context,should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction.
   </Callout>

## Check for logging data [#test-extension-java]

To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following:

* Includes `trace.id` and `span.id` fields
* Is properly-formatted JSON lines

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) using the [query operator](/docs/new-relic-logs-query-syntax) `has: span.id/trace.id`.

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Troubleshoot errors with [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).
