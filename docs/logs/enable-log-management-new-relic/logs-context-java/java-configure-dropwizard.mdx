New Relic offers a [Dropwizard](https://dropwizard.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3.x/manual/core.html#logging) extension for [log management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs), allowing you link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and start getting log data. The [code](https://github.com/newrelic/java-log-extensions/tree/main/dropwizard) and an [example application](https://github.com/newrelic/java-log-extensions/tree/main/examples/dropwizard-app) are available on GitHub.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements-dropwizard]

To use New Relic logs in context with Dropwizard 1.3, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* Java agent 5.6.0 or higher: [Install](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent)
* JVM argument [`-javaagent`](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/include-java-agent-jvm-argument) enabled on the Java agent.
* [Dropwizard 1.3](https://dropwizard.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3.x/manual/core.html#logging) package installed and working on the application, with the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory.

## Configure logs in context with New Relic Logs [#configure-logs]

To configure logs in context with Dropwizard:

1. [Enable log monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs).
2. [Install or update the Java agent](#java-extension).
3. [Configure the Dropwizard extension](#enable-logs-dropwizard).
4. [Check for logging data.](#test-extension-java)

## Enable log monitoring [#enable-logs]

Confirm that you have [log monitoring](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) enabled, with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs) installed to send your application logs to New Relic.

## Install or update the Java agent [#java-extension]

[Install](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent) to the most recent Java agent version, and [enable Distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing).

## Configure the Dropwizard extension [#enable-logs-dropwizard]

To configure logs in context with the Dropwizard 1.3 extension, complete the following steps:

1. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable:

   * To update with Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

     ```
     dependencies {
         compile("com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0")
     }
     ```
   * To update with Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

     ```
     <dependencies>
         <dependency>
             <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId>
             <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId>
             <version>2.0</version>
         </dependency>
     </dependencies>
     ```
2. Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a `newrelic-json` layout, replacing the currently used `type: console` or `type: file` with either `type: newrelic-console` or `type: newrelic-file` as appropriate. For example:

   ```
   logging:
     appenders:
       - <var>type: newrelic-console</var>
         # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender.
         # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type.
         layout: 
           <var>type: newrelic-json</var>
   ```

   Alternatively, the New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a `log-format` layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change

   ```
   logging:
     appenders:
       - type: newrelic-file
         # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout.
         logFormat: "%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n"
         layout: 
           # type: newrelic-json
           type: log-format
   ```

## Check for logging data [#test-extension-java]

To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following:

* Includes `trace.id` and `span.id` fields
* Is properly-formatted JSON lines

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) using the [query operator](/docs/new-relic-logs-query-syntax) `has: span.id/trace.id`.

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Troubleshoot errors with [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).
