Use the [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) output [plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output) to easily forward your logs to [New Relic](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs). This plugin is also provided in a standalone Docker image that can be installed in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster in the form of a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/), which we refer as the _Kubernetes plugin_.

## Requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To forward your logs to New Relic using the Kubernetes plugin, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* A [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) cluster deployed

## Enable Kubernetes for logs management [#enable-process]

To enable logs management with the Fluent Bit Kubernetes plugin:

1. [Install](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#installation) the Kubernetes plugin.
2. When installing the plugin as a Helm chart, you can set [numerous configurations](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/newrelic-logging#configuration). However, we recommend the standard setup, as it is valid for most users.
3. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then [check your account](#find-data) for data.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM Log
  ```

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable New Relic Logs, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
