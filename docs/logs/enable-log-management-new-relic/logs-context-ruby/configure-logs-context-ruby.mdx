Logs in context for the Ruby agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic, giving full context to high-level events and providing high value data to specific log lines. Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To use log management with the Ruby agent, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* Ruby agent 6.7.0 or higher: [Install](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/install-new-relic-ruby-agent) or [update](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/install-new-relic-ruby-agent#Updating_the_Agent)
* [Supported Rails version](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/ruby-agent-requirements-supported-frameworks#web_frameworks) (for Rails applications)

## Configure logs in context with log management [#configure-logs]

To configure logs in context with Ruby:

1. [Enable log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs).
2. [Install or update the Ruby agent](#ruby-agent).
3. [Configure logs in context for Ruby](#enable-logs-ruby).
4. [Optional: Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).
5. [Check for logging data.](#check-data-ruby)

## Enable log management [#enable-logs]

Confirm that you have [log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) enabled, with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs) installed to send your application logs to New Relic.

## Install or update the Ruby agent [#ruby-agent]

[Install](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/install-new-relic-ruby-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/update-ruby-agent) to the most recent Ruby agent version, and [enable distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing).

## Configure logs in context for Ruby [#enable-logs-ruby]

### Configure for Rails [#enable-rails]

Rails logging is controlled by two components: a logger (customizable by setting `config.logger`) and a log formatter (customizable by setting `config.log_formatter`). In most cases, logs in context should be configured by setting `config.log_formatter` to the `DecoratingFormatter` in your Rails application. For more guidance regarding Rails configuration, see [Configuring Rails Applications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html).

In your application's config, require `'newrelic_rpm'`, then add the following line:

```
module ________
  class Application < Rails::Application

    ...

    config.log_formatter = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new
  end
end
```

This will use the New Relic formatter to format log messages, but the rest of the logging configuration will be provided by the other Rails config settings.

Please note that Logs in Context for Ruby does not currently support tagged logging; if you are initializing your logger with a `log_tags` argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs.

### Rails advanced configuration [#rails-adv-config]

If setting the `log_formatter` option doesn't meet your needs, replace the entire Rails logger with an instance of the New Relic logger. Provide the parameters to the logger's constructor, like this:

```
module ________
  class Application < Rails::Application

    ...

    config.logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new(
      "log/application.log", #etc...
    )
  end
end
```

### Configure for Ruby without Rails [#enable-ruby]

For non-Rails applications, use the `DecoratingLogger` in place of the Ruby standard `::Logger`, like this:

```
logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new(
  'log/application.log', #etc...
)
...
  
logger.info(...)
```

The `DecoratingLogger` is a drop-in replacement for the Ruby standard `::Logger`. Their constructors accept the same parameters.

## Advanced configuration

### Custom logger configuration [#custom-adv-config]

To use our logging extension with a different logging implementation, or your own custom logger, use the `DecoratingFormatter`.

Example:

```
module ________
  class Application < Rails::Application

    ...

    config.logger = ::YourCustomLoggerImplementation.new(
      $stdout,
      formatter: ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new
    )
  end
end
```

### Lograge configuration [#lograge-adv-config]

To configure this extension with the [lograge gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/lograge), there is no additional configuration required.

## Check for logging data [#check-data-ruby]

If you have configured your logging in `/config/application.rb`, or in `/config/environments/development.rb`, run your application locally and check its logging output. You should see some output like this:

```
{"entity.name":"your_app_name","entity.type":"SERVICE","hostname":"79bcbf8d","trace.id":"79bcbf8d","span.id":"00fc7d46","timestamp":1567701375543,"message":"example log message one","log.level":"DEBUG"}
{"entity.name":"your_app_name","entity.type":"SERVICE","hostname":"79bcbf8d","trace.id":"79bcbf8d","span.id":"6754870b","timestamp":1567702843604,"message":"example log message two","log.level":"DEBUG"}
```

If you have deployed this application to an environment with a [log forwarder](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs), your application's logs will appear in the New Relic [Logs UI](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/ui-data/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui) with metadata linking them to a trace and a span. You can find them using a query like this:

```
entity.name:"your_app_name" has:trace.id
```

If you see JSON logs in your application's output, but no logs returned by a query like the above, check your [log forwarder](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs).

## Troubleshooting

If the logs from your application are not formatted in JSON with fields like `trace.id` and `span.id`, there may be a problem with the configuration of the New Relic Logging Extension.

Check that:

* the application is using a [supported logging framework](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs).
* the [configuration](#advanced-configuration) has been applied to all the environments where you would like to use the New Relic Logging Extension.
* there is not another logger configured later in the configuration of the application.

## Incompatible gems [#incompabilities]

The New Relic decorating logger is known to be incompatible with the following gems:

* [logging](https://rubygems.org/gems/logging)
* [semantic logger](https://rubygems.org/gems/semantic_logger)
* [rails_stdout_logger](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_stdout_logging)
* [rails_12factor](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_12factor)

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Troubleshoot errors with [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).
