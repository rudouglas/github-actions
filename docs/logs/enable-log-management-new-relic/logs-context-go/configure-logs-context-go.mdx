Logs in context for the Go agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic, giving full context to high-level events, as well as providing high value data to specific log lines. Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data.

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To use log management with the Go agent, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements:

* Go agent 2.12 or higher: [Install](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/install-new-relic-go) or [update](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/update-go-agent)
* [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) logging framework v1.4.0 or higher

## Configure logs in context with log management [#configure-logs]

To configure New Relic logs in context with Go:

1. [Enable log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs).
2. [Install or update the Go agent](#go-plugin).
3. [Configure logs in context using the Logrus extension](#configure-plugin-go).
4. [Optional: Configure](#instrument-plugin-go) the Logrus extension.
5. [Check for logging data.](#test-extension-go)

## Enable log management [#enable-logs]

Confirm that you have [log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) enabled, with a compatible [log forwarding plugin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs) installed to send your application logs to New Relic.

## Install or update the Go agent [#go-plugin]

[Install](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/install-new-relic-go) or [update](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/install-new-relic-go) to the most recent Go agent version, and [enable Distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing).

## Configure logs in context using the Logrus extension [#configure-plugin-go]

To configure the Logrus plugin:

1. This step assumes that you have imported the following packages in files where Logrus is configured:

   ```
   import (
       log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
       "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/logcontext/nrlogrusplugin"
       "github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
   )
   ```
2. Set the Logrus formatter to `nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter`:

   ```
   logger := log.New()
   logger.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{})
   ```

   Or, if you are using the Logrus standard logger:

   ```
   log.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{})
   ```

   The logger will now look for a `newrelic.Transaction` inside its context and decorate logs accordingly.
3. Update your standard logging call to include contextual logging and pass this to the logger.

   For example, instead of `logger.Info("Hello New Relic!")`, use

   ```
   ctx := newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn)
   logger.WithContext(ctx).Info("Hello New Relic!")
   ```

   where `txn` is the current running transaction.

## Check for logging data [#test-extension-go]

To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following:

1. Includes `trace.id` and `span.id` fields
2. Is properly-formatted JSON lines

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) using the [query operator](/docs/new-relic-logs-query-syntax) `has:span.id OR has:trace.id`

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* Troubleshoot errors with [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).
