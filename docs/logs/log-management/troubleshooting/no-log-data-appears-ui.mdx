## Problem

After [enabling log management](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs), no data appears in your Logs UI after about five minutes.

## Solution

If no data appears after you send some log payloads and wait about five minutes, try the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Logs troubleshooting
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Access to data
      </td>

      <td>
        See [Factors affecting access to features and data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Compatibility
      </td>

      <td>
        Make sure you've installed a [compatible log forwarding plugin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/enable-new-relic-logs#enable-logs).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Status codes
      </td>

      <td>
        Check the response status code being returned from the New Relic log collection endpoint. For example, you might see:

        ```
        HTTP Error 403: Forbidden. Review your license key.
        ```

        This error means that you're using an invalid security key. New Relic requires an [Insights API Insert key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api#register) or [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) to enable log shipping. An `HTTP 202` response is a success.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Errors
      </td>

      <td>
        Run a query using the [`NrIntegrationErrors` NRQL event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrIntegrationError) to see if any errors are related to logging. For example, look for messages like:

        ```
        Error parsing JSON payload
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Checking for Data
      </td>

      <td>
        Try querying the `Log` data type using Insights. For example, you can use a [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) query to look at everything in the Log eventType. If no data appears in Insights, then no data will appear in the Logs UI.

        ```
        SELECT * FROM Log
        ```

        For information on querying in general, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

    </tr>
