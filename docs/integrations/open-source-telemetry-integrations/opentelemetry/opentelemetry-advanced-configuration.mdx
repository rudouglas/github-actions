In some cases, you may need to change the default settings related to OpenTelemetry. Here are some advanced configurations that are available.

## Change endpoints

You can change the New Relic endpoints where you send your data. By default, New Relic OpenTelemetry exporters send data to these US data centers:

* Spans: [https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1](https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1)
* Metrics: [https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1](https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1)

You may need to override these default endpoints to send data to the EU region or to use Infinite Tracing.

### EU region

To send telemetry data to New Relicâ€™s endpoints in the EU region, use the following:

<Callout variant="tip">
  These URLs don't apply to Infinite Tracing
</Callout>

* Spans: [https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1](https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1)
* Metrics: [https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1](https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1)

### Infinite Tracing

If you are setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to override the default span endpoint and send telemetry data to the New Relic trace observer:

1. Follow the steps in [Set up the trace observer](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer) to get the value for <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>.
2. Use the value of <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var> to configure your integration.
3. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the `AlwaysOn` sampler.
