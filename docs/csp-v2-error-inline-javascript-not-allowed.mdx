title: 'CSP v2 error: Inline JavaScript not allowed'
type: troubleshooting

## Problem

You are attempting to install New Relic's Browser agent using the auto-injection or copy/paste method. You see an error message indicating that inline scripts cannot run on the page.

## Solution

In order to install the New Relic Browser agent when your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception:

1. Follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team and request an exception.
2. Follow New Relic's procedures to [install the Browser agent for CSP](/docs/csp-v2-host-install-browser-agent).

If your organization has a strict process that prohibits CSP exceptions, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com) to discuss other options.

## Cause

[Content Security Policy v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/) adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed (such as inline scripts). It also limits [which domains can load scripts](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-browser#csp) during page load.

CSP has multiple levels of complexity. Depending on how it is applied to your pages, it will impact how the Browser agent runs.
