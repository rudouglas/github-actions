As part of the [policy workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow), create a condition for your policy. This involves three steps:

1. Select the available [product category](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) (APM, Browser, Mobile, etc.) and the type of condition (metric or external service).
2. Select specific entities or components monitored by that product as one or more **targets** for the alert condition.
3. Define the criteria ([thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert)) that trigger a violation incident.

This describes how to add and update the product targets.

## Add entities to a condition [#adding-targets]

For your convenience, the user interface organizes entities (targets) into logical folders. You can use these folders to edit entities anytime. If applicable, the target folders reflect what your organization has defined for [labels and rollup categories](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers).

<Callout variant="important">
  With the exception of [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information), there's a [limit](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/minimum-maximum-values) to the number of entities you may add to a condition.

## View existing targets [#alert-target-view]

The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing entities for an alert condition:

4. To view detailed information about entities associated with a condition, click **Notification channels**.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To view [policy and condition information for a specific entity](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/view-policy-conditions-new-relic-products), select the **Settings > Alert conditions** page from the entity's product UI.
</Callout>

## Update a condition's entities [#updating-targets]

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, click **Alert policies**, then **(select a policy)**.
2. From the list of existing conditions, select the target name (for example, `My app - Production`) or number of targets (for example, `3 Targets`).
