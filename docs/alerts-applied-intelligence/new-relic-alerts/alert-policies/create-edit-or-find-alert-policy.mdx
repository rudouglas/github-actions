A [policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow#terminology) is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the [REST API](/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts).

For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see [Concepts and workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alert-policy-workflow).

<Callout variant="tip">
  The [basic setup process](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow) is the same, regardless of which product (APM, Browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source.

## Best practices for naming policies [#best-practices-policies]

We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies:

* Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being
* Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture
* Individual policies for specific users

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Policies organized by...**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Architecture
      </td>

      <td>
        Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the **environment** type (production, staging, integration, development) or the **target or resource** type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.).

        To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example:

        * Product A website (production)
        * Product B website (staging)
        * Mobile product app (iOS)
        * Hosts (production)
        * Databases (production)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Teams
      </td>

      <td>
        Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy `Team: Site engineering`, `Team: Website development`, etc.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Individuals
      </td>

      <td>
        Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others.

        To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, `User: John Doe's metrics`, `User: Jane Doe (production)`, etc.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Create an alert policy [#alert-policy-name]

As part of the [policy workflow](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/alert-policy-workflow), start by giving the policy a meaningful name:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Policies.**
2. On the policy index page, click <Icon name="fe-plus-circle"/>
   **New alert policy**.
3. Type a [meaningful name](#best-practices-policies) for the policy (maximum 64 characters).
4. Select the [incident preference](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).
5. Select **Create alert policy**.

You can continue from here to [define the conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) and [assign one or more notification channels](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels). If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the **Alert policies** index.

## Change a policy name [#rename-policy]

For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name.

To rename an existing policy:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Policies**, and then (**select a policy)**.
2. Click the policy name to edit it, then type a [meaningful name](#best-practices-policies) for the policy (maximum 64 characters).

Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels.

## View existing policies [#alert-policy-view]

The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies:

1. In the **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")** top nav, click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Policies.**
2. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list.
3. To view detailed information, click a policy name.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To view [policy and condition information for a specific entity](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/view-policy-conditions-new-relic-products), select the **Settings > Alert conditions** page from the entity's product UI.
