## Reintroduction of the following:

### Improvements

* Prevent blacklisted resources from causing timeouts on Synthetics Checks
* Prevents long running background requests from failing a monitor if the `pageLoadEvent` is detected. Common examples include Google Analytics and `bam.nr-data.net`.

### Features

* Added functionality where `$browser.waitForAndFindElement()` now returns a WebElementPromise, so users can issue commands to the webElement that is returned from the promise.
