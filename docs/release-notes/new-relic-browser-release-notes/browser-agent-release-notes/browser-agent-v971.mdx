### Notes

The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.

### New features

* **Add support for keyboard change events \[Pro+SPA]:** Keyboard events will now automatically trigger a Browser Interaction timing.
* **Browser Timing Events now have Traced Callback Duration \[Pro+SPA]**: In order to match the attributes on other New Relic Browser related events, the Browser Timing events now include callback durations by default.

### Improvements

* **Change harvest to not use sendBeacon**: We now use the `sendBeacon` native API only for page unload. The agent will now attempt to use an XHR when available and save `sendBeacon` for `unload` events, in order to reduce the data transferred using the sendBeacon API.

### How to upgrade

To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see [Upgrade Browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/upgrade-browser-agent).
