### Distributed tracing for cross-origin AJAX calls

The agent can now add the `newrelic` distributed tracing header to outgoing cross-origin AJAX calls. The origins that the agent should add headers to must be defined in the `distributed_tracing.allowed_origins` configuration section. Users can now enable CORS from the Browser 'Application settings' page. For complete feature documentation, visit the [Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing#cors) section of our [Browser data in distributed tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing) documentation.
