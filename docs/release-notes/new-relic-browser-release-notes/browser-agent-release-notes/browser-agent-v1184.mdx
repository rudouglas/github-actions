## New Features

### Added support for custom attributes on PageViewTiming events

Custom attributes created using the [setCustomAttribute API method](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/setcustomattribute-browser-agent-api) will now be included in all [PageViewTiming events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/pageviewtiming-async-or-dynamic-page-details).

## Issue Resolutions

* \[SPA- BrowserInteractions] Fixed an issue resulting from too many fetch requests

  * Resolved a bug throwing a null reference error during browser interactions where more than 128 fetch requests were recorded and distributed tracing was enabled.
* \[PageViewTiming] Fixed an edge-case issue with the paint timing instrumentation

  * In cases when nothing was painted to screen before the load event, the agent would throw an error. We have added a guard for this scenario.
* \[PageViewTiming] Fixed issue with Largest Contentful Paint recording

  * The browser agent stops recording largest contentful paint after 60 seconds on a page. We fixed an issue where recording continued beyond that threshold.
