### Notes

The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.

### Improvements

* **Adjusted PageAction limits:** Previously, we limited PageAction events to 120 per page load and only 20 events per harvest cycle, resulting in dropped data if a user sent more than 20 pageAction events in a single burst. Increasing the harvest time to 30 seconds also increases the event buffer, allowing users to send up to 60 events per harvest.
* **Improved time measurement:** Previously, the agent used the system clock to calculate timing, and since the system clock may shift over the lifecycle of a page, the agent could occasionally report inaccurate or unexpectedly negative values. Going forward, the agent will use `perfomance.now()`, which is a monotonically increasing clock that starts from `navigationStart`. This change will result in more accurate timing for modern browsers.

### Bug fixes

* **Preserve event listeners:** Previously, if the agent doesn't load correctly it affected the functionality of `add-` and `removeEventListener`. These will now function the same whether the agent loads or not.
