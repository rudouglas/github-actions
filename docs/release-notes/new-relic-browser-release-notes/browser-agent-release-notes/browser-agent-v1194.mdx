## Improvements

### Optimized instrumentation of promises

The promise instrumentation has been updated to reduce performance overhead on web sites that use large number of promises.

## Issue Resolutions

### Fixed issue with SPA overhead

In a rare case where large number of callbacks are executed at the end of an interaction, the agent could cause a significant overhead. This has been fixed in this version of the agent.

### Fixed issue with Fetch instrumentation

Updated fetch instrumentation to account for cases when the function argument is a URL object.
