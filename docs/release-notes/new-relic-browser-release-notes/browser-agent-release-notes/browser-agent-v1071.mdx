### Notes

The Browser agent, sometimes called the JavaScript agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.

### New features

* **Link JS Errors to Browser Interactions (relevant only for PRO+SPA):** When a JS error occurs inside a browser interaction event, the error will now be associated with the interaction via Insights attributes.

BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events will now have the following attributes: `browserInteractionId`, `eventId`, and `parentEventId`.

### Bug fixes

* **JSONP Tracking Breaks in some versions of Safari (relevant only for PRO+SPA):** Previously, the agent would cause Safari browsers to lock up when JSONP requests returned large data. The agent no longer calculates JSONP response size.

### How to upgrade

To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see [Upgrade the Browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/upgrade-browser-agent).
