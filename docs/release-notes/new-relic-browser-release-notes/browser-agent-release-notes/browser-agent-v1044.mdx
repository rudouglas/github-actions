### Notes

The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.

### Bug fixes

* **Improved Agent Performance:** Improvements to how the agent verifies interactions are complete by setting and clearing multiple timers. Previously, the agent would make many unnecessary calls to clearTimeout, and will now only clear timers when appropriate.
* **Protect against custom events:** Improvements to how the agent determines the event origin for Session Traces. In some libraries that use custom event wrappers, when the agent calls `target` on an event it can throw an exception. The agent now catches these types of exceptions when building Session Traces.

### How to upgrade
