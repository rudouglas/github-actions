### New features

* **Custom attributes are now added to JavascriptError events:** Custom attributes collected with the [setCustomAttribute()](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/set-custom-attribute) and [interaction.setAttribute()](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/spa-set-attribute) API methods are now added to JavascriptError events.
* **Updated the noticeError() API:** The noticeError() API method now accepts a second argument for custom attributes. For more details and examples, see the [noticeError() documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/notice-error).

### Improvements

* **Updated the timing of when page URL is collected:** The URL collected by the agent and used for page view names is now collected after the load event to account for redirects. Currently, we are using the referrer header value from the initial agent call for transaction naming and for URL attributes on Insights events. The agent also sends the URL value as a part of its payload to get around HTTP header stripping. This update brings this value on a par with the HTTP header by capturing it at the time the agent call is made.
