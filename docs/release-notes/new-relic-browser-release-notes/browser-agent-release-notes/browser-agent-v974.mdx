### Notes

The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.

### New features

* **Added newrelic.setErrorHandler API to allow for selective ignoring of known errors \[Pro, Pro+SPA]**: This API takes a single error handler function, which will be called for each error the agent captures. If the handler returns true, the error will NOT be recorded by New Relic, otherwise it will be processed normally.

For details on how to use this API, see our [Browser API Docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/report-data-events-browser-agent-api#seterrorhandler).

### How to upgrade

To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see [Upgrade Browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/upgrade-browser-agent).
