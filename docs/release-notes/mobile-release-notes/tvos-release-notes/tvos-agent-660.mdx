### Improvements

* Bumped session attribute limit to 128 from 64.

### Fixes

* `+recordCustomEvent:withName:attributes:` no longer requires a dictionary to capture `name`.
* Values in attributes dictionaries passed to `recordEvent` APIs will no longer be cast to int or float values, which degraded large data types.
