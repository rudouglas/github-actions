### Improvements

* Added support for control characters in Insights data. Control characters will now be displayed by their common escaped character representation. For example: an 'end-of-text' control character will be displayed as '^C'.

### Fixes

* Removed instrumentation of ASI networking framework. This prevents collisions with Apple's private API scans, which produces a false positive when scanning our instrumentation of this library. We recommend anyone still using ASI for networking to use our [custom network instrumentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/work-ios-sdk-api) tools going forward.
