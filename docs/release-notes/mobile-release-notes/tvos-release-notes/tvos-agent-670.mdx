### Improvements

* The NewRelic NSURLSessionTaskDelegate object now provides an `isKindOfClass:` method that presents as the wrapped class. This improves compatibility with other frameworks.

### Fixes

* Fixes potential crash if `_dyld_register_func_for_add_image` callback is executed in an unexpected way.
