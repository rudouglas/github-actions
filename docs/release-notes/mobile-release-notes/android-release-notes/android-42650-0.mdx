### Improvements

* This release adds instrumentation for versions 2.1+ of Square's OkHttp library. 1.x versions continue to be supported.
* This release also adds support for the Retrofit (1.8+) and Picasso (2.4+) libraries from Square.

### Notes

* With this release, the Android SDK will require a minimum version of Android 2.3. Apps requiring Android 2.2 can still use the legacy version of the New Relic Mobile Android SDK, 4.244.0 ([instructions here](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/android/installing-android-apps-android-22-support)). The legacy version will only receive critical updates if necessary.
* Please note that versions 2.x of the OkHttp library require Android 2.3+ and Java 7. (see [https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-200](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-200))
