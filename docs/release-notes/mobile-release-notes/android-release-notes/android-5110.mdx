### New in this release

#### Adds recording of network request error events

The agent now generates _MobileRequestError_ events describing failures in network requests. This new event tracks networking and HTTP errors, and includes attributes for common request properties. More details can be found at [Mobile Request Error Events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobilerequesterror-events-insights).

#### Adds additional session attributes

* _lastInteraction_ allows you to see in Insights, what the most common exit screen was for customers across all sessions or a filtered selection of sessions.
* _appBuild_ allow developers to view the adoption of a new build, particularly if rolled out under an existing app version number. Originally, this was only available on crash events.
* _architecture_ and _runTime_ allow you to see the hardware type and Java runtime version the of the device on which the app is running. Both values are taken form the device's system properties, and are useful for debugging device-specific issues.

### Fixed in this release

* #### Fix the _minimum utilization_ instrumentation filter

  Slow interaction trace capture relied on an incorrectly interpreted minimum utilization value. In some cases you may see more slow interaction traces than previous agent versions. Please reach out to support if you are not seeing slow interaction traces.
* #### Fix crash when using OkHttp 3.2.0 web sockets

  Although the Android agent does not _officially_ support OkHttp versions prior to 3.4, this fix avoids crashes that may occur when including 3rd-party libraries that may depend on those versions of OkHttp.
* #### Warn when agent and class rewriter versions do not match

  Instead of halting a build of the application, the agent will warn of this benign scenario. Agent JAR version mismatch sometimes occurs when upgrading to a new agent version.
* #### Fix ConcurrentModificationException crash

  This change addresses a rarely seen crash that occurs during agent start-up.
* #### Move remaining sampler shutdown to background thread

  This change addresses a lag seen during interaction trace completion.
