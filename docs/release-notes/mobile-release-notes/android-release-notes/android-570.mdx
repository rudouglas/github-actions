### New in this release

* We are pleased to announce support for Dexguard.
  * Full build time compatibility with _Dexguard version 7.2.04 or higher_
  * Full instrumentation support
  * De-obfuscated crash reportÂ stack traces

### Fixes

* The New Relic Gradle plugin depends on the Android application or library plugin having been installed first. The New Relic plugin now throws a Gradle runtime exception, which includes instructions on how to fix the problem, if it is applied before Android.
* Interaction trace completion was blocked on the sampling tasks running during the interaction. Any running sample tasks are stopped immediately when the interaction trace completes.

### Changes

* _The Android agent now requires_ _Proguard version 5.0 or higher for Proguard support_
