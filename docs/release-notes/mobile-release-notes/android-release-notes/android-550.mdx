### Improvements

This release adds a new feature flag, _DefaultInteractions_, that controls whether automatically instrumented (default) interactions are collected by the agent. With auto-instrumented interactions disabled, only custom interactions (interactions created through the public New Relic agent API) will be recorded. This flag is _**enabled**_ by default, and is disabled by calling

`NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.DefaultInteractions);`

### Fixes

* Fixes a problem reading a response body in asynchronous network requests via OkHttp, which was introduced by version 5.4.1.
