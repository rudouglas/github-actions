### New in this release

* The [NetworkRequests feature flag](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/api-guides/android-agent-configuration-feature-flags#ff-networkRequests) is now enabled by default. The feature can still be disabled (and re-enabled) at any time if the additional [MobileRequest events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-events-attributes#mobilerequest-attributes) are not needed.
* Added a feature flag for MobileHandledException events (`FeatureFlag.HandledExceptions`). Handled exception reporting is enabled by default; use this flag to globally disable the feature.

### Fixed in this release

* Crash reports are again uploaded immediately, rather than during the next scheduled harvest.
* Correctly detects Proguard/Dexguard-enabled apps, and uploads their mapping.txt files to the symbol upload collector.
* Restored missing instrumentation of Square Retrofit2 classes.
* Added missing response codes from `HttpURLConnection` POST requests.
* The MobileRequest event `byteSent` attribute has been renamed to `bytesSent`. Any Insights queries using `byteSent` must be updated to maintain accuracy.
