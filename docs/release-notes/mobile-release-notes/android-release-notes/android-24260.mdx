### Improvements

* The agent now detects if the app was instrumented properly and displays an error message if otherwise.
* The Eclipse plugin now refreshes your project after installing/updating New Relic.
* Improved post installation messaging in Eclipse.

### Fixes

* Fixes an issue in Eclipse on Windows where Eclipse is installed in a location with a space in the path.
* Repackaged the agent with JarJar to prevent class space collisions.
* Fixes an issue where a re-used HttpRequest object would have multiple X-NewRelic-ID headers added.
