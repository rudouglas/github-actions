### Fixes

* Prevent duplication of the New Relic HTTP header used for cross application tracing ('X-NewRelic-Id') if the request is replayed through OkHttp
* The agent will now send the HTTP header 'X-NewRelic-Id' (used for cross application tracing) using exactly that casing (it was previously lowercased)
* Failed OkHttp requests will now correctly report the full error response body

### Changes

This release will be the last to support the New Relic Eclipse plugin for Eclipse IDE's. Eclipse users are encouraged to use the [Eclipse Gradle plugin](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/android/installing-android-apps-eclipse-gradle-plugin) or migrate to [Android Studio](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/android/installing-android-apps-gradle-android-studio). Eclipse users may continue to use this (5.4.1) or any previous agent release.
