### New in this release

* Support for the Maven plugin is now deprecated, and will be removed in version 5.21.0.
* The minimum supported SDK level (`minSdkVersion`) is now 14 (Android 4.0)

### Fixed in this release

* Removed dependency on legacy Android Apache library, which resulted in `NoClassDefFoundError` exceptions when targeting Android SDK 28.
* Removed cast exception with OkHTTP2 CacheResponseBody when using Retrofit 1.9.0 with OkHttp 2.7.5 .
* Corrected mismatched UUID added to Proguard/Dexguard mapping file (the map UUID didn't match the UUID of reported crashes).
* Restored missing Dexguard lambda instrumentation.
* Corrected representation of LONG numeric attributes to prevent loss of precision (agent could not record precise timestamp attributes).
* Crashes that occur prior to successfully connecting to collector will be queued until a valid connection data token is received.
* Restored agent shutdown and final harvest when foreground services present.
