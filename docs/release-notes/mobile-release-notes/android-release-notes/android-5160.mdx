### New in this release

* MobileRequestError events now contain the response body returned in the network request response, if one exists. Response bodies will only be reported if the [withHttpResponseBodyCaptureEnabled feature flag](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/api-guides/android-agent-configuration-feature-flags#ff-withHttpResponseBodyCaptureEnabled) is enabled. HttpResponseBodyCapture is enabled by default. Response body data will be limited to the first 4096 bytes (the Insights attribute limit). A content type attribute will also be added to the event if a "content_type" header is found in the response.
* MobileRequestError events now also contain any cross-application tracing (CAT) data returned in the response headers. See [Introduction to cross-application traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/introduction-cross-application-traces) for more information.

### Fixed in this release

* Stream file handle usage during class instrumentation has been tightened up to prevent potential resource leaks.
* Proguard map detection of release variants when using AndroidStudio 3 has been restored.
* Add content type parameter missing from HTTP error traces when instrumenting OkHttp2, OkHttp3 and Retrofit requests.
