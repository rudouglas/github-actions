### New in this release

* Added a new _MobileBreadcrumb_ event type that allows you to annotate the execution of your app, to help troubleshoot crashes and provide greater detail in Insights. See the [recordBreadcrumb()](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api/recordbreadcrumb) API docs for more information.
* Added an additional _recordCustomEvent_ method that takes the event name as an optional parameter. This avoids the need to add a name attribute in the passed attribute set. See the [recordCustomEvent()](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api/record-custom-event) API docs for more information.
