## New in this release

### Enhanced the New Relic Gradle plugin's build-time reporting of ProGuard/DexGuard maps

* Maps will only be reported during select variant builds (i.e., Release)
* Build variants are assigned unique build IDs
* Maps can be compressed prior to upload

Please refer to [Android agent crash reporting](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/android-agent-crash-reporting) for more detail regarding these features. These features are configurable through the [New Relic Gradle Plugin extension](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/configure-agent-gradle-plugin-extension) and existing `newrelic.properties`.

## Fixed in this release

* Fixed build errors that occur when older (pre-3.0) versions of the Android Gradle Plugin is used
* Fixed 'IllegalStateException' crash that resulted when header queries were made to failed HttpsUrlConnection requests
