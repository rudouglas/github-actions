### Fixed in this release

* Validate custom event type names with the same rules as the backend service, reporting invalid event types to the user immediately. Previous agent versions would allow custom event type names that would be rejected by Insights during ingest. The name may be comprised of alphanumeric, space, `.`, `:` or `_` characters.
