### New in this release

* The agent now reports network request events to Insights! This feature must be enabled when starting the agent using the _NetworkRequests_ FeatureFlag. When enabled all network calls will be tracked, in addition to network errors.

  We've also added a new document that describes how to query network events from Insights. [Mobile Request Query Examples](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-attributes/mobile-request-query-examples-mobilerequest) provides useful queries for examining network request event data.

### Fixed in this release

* Ensure there is no shared activity history state between launched sessions.
