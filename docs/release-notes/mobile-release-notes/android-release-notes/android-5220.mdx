## New in this release

* Updated instrumentation support for OkHttp to version 3.12.0
  * Minimum supported versions are now OkHttp 3.5.0, and OkIO 1.11.0
* Dependency JARs using [signature validation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Signature_Validation) are detected during instrumentation. The agent cannot instrument JARs that use [signature validation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Signature_Validation) when signed. JARs whose manifest contains SHA1-Digest or SHA-256-Digest manifest attributes will not be modified
* Increase the number of available user attributes from 64 to 128

## Fixed in this release

* Fixes null pointer exception during map upload when the generated map file is empty, such as when Proguard is enabled, but obfuscation is disabled using the **-dontobfuscate** Proguard configuration setting.
