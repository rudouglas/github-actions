### New in this release

* **Added instrumentation support for Android Instant Apps**
  The agent now detects and instruments all feature modules for an instant app. Because instant apps are typically side-loaded, users must add NewRelic.start() calls to each entry point activity in the module. We've also created a document to help integrate the agent into your Instant App. See [Install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/install-new-relic-plugin-android-instant-apps) for more information.

### Fixed in this release

* Correctly restore any pre-existing unhandled exception handler when the agent shuts downs. Maintain the state of existing unhandled exception handlers when the agent returns to foreground.
* Fixed instrumentation of abstract classes derived from Android SDK classes.
* Fixed instrumentation failure when using certain Java 8 features, such as lambdas.
* Updated instrumentation support for Dexguard 8 on Android Studio 3.0.
* Enforce @SkipTrace with Android SDK-derived classes. Previously, onCreate() and onCreateView() could not be skipped from Activity, Fragment and other SDK classes.
