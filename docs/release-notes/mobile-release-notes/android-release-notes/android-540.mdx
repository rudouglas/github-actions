### Improvements

* Interaction tracing can now be globally disabled with the [new API method](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-sdk-api/new-relic-mobile-sdk-api/work-android-sdk-api#disable-interactions), `NewRelic.withInteractionTracing(boolean)`. This method should be called prior to starting the agent, but it can be changed any time thereafter. Interaction tracing will be disabled after the agent has started; interactions for any activity or methods executed prior to starting the agent may still appear in the Interactions page.

### Fixes

* A bug introduced in the previous release that resulted in missing analytics data in crash reports has been fixed.
* The session ID is now correctly updated when the app returns to foreground. Unique session counts were not affected.
* Additional safeguards were added to prevent agent from starting or harvesting when app is in the background.
