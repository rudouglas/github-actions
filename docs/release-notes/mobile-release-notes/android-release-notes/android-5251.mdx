### Fixed in this release

* Fixed detection of DexGuard-generated mapping.txt files ("_mappingFile is null_")
* Update OkHttp request transaction state when interceptors are used
* Improved visibility into obfuscation map uploads. Users can invoke the Gradle task _newRelicMapUpload&#x7B;Variant}_ (_newRelicDexguardMapUpload&#x7B;Variant}_ for DexGuard) to resend tagged obfuscation maps. _&#x7B;Variant}_ is dependent on configuration.
* Toned-down plugin debugging messages inadvertently emitted as errors
