### Notes

**Improvements**

* ARM64 support - you can now compile New Relic in your native 64-bit applications.
* Improved sub-millisecond timing resolution on method tracing. Blame breakdowns and interaction traces will now have improved "total time" and "total exclusive time" measurements.

**Fixes**

* Resolves a crashing timing-related issue in method tracing. Relevant exceptions include note of "object cannot be nil" or "setObject:forKey:" with a nil value.
* Resolves several stability and accuracy issues in the NRTimer class.
