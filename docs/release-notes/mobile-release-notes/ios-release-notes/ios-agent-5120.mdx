### Improvements

* Adds new API `+[NewRelic recordCustomEvent:(NSString*)eventType withAttributes:(NSDictionary*)attributes]`

This method replaces `+[NewRelic recordEvent:(NSString*)name withAttributes:(NSDictionary*)attributes]` which is now deprecated, with the intention of removal in the future. The new API creates a new event with an event type specified by the `eventType` parameter, whereas the deprecated method create a event with the Mobile event type and an attribute with the name 'name' and the value of the `name` parameter. This change satisfies customer requests for:

* Improved Insights query performance
* Defining custom event types
* Finding custom event in Insights more easily
* Flexibility to define data retention per custom event type
