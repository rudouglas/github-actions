## Notes

### Improvements

* Fixed build errors in NewRelicFeatureFlags.h that occurred if NewRelic.h was imported before foundation.h in the prefix.pch file.
* Interaction traces period is more discrete. An interaction will only record traces until a new interaction is started, rather than combining the data into one interaction.
* The method `+[NRTaskQueue dequeue]` will no longer fire on the UI thread.
* Interaction traces now have more easily identifiable names. Instead of “ViewController#Method” they will now be named “Display ViewController”.
* The healthy interaction timer will no longer fire repeatedly over very short intervals.
* The agent will no longer crash if the instrumented method:; `[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:queue:completionHandler:]` is passed a nil completionHandler.

### Fixes

* Default interaction traces can now be renamed by adding `@protocol NewRelicCustomInteractionInterface`( (defined in NewRelic.h) to the traced view controller.
* Added new method for starting a custom interaction trace +startInteractionWithName: (defined in NewRelic.h)
* Deprecated the following methods in NewRelic.h : `+startInterationFromMethodName:object:`, `+startInterationFromMethodName:object:customizedName`, and `+startInterationFromMethodName:object:cancelRunningTrace:`. Use `+startInteractionWithName:` instead.
* Added method `+stopCurrentInteraction:` to NewRelic.h. Allows user to stop a custom interaction trace manually.
