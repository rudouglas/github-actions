### Notes

#### Improvements

* Improved logging to identify when crash reporting is disabled during debugging.
* You can now disable the capture of the HTTP response body for requests by calling the `disableFeature` method and passing the flag `NRMAFeatureFlag_httpResponseCapture`.
* Added support for the armv7s architecture as it is not available in Xcode 6.
* The SDK was updated to accept the HTTP method in the signature of the `[NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL]` and `[NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL]` methods allowing more detailed information to be collected.
* The version of the New Relic iOS agent was added to the comments in **NewRelic.h** for convenience.

#### Fixes

* Corrected a potentially crashing situation when calling `[NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL]`.
* Updated SDK to include iOS agent symbols in crash reports that may include New Relic code.
* Removed potential deadlock on main thread for reachability requests by moving reachability flags off the main thread.
* Resolves a crashing issue with Swift related to cases where `class_getSuperClass()` was called with the root Swift class.
