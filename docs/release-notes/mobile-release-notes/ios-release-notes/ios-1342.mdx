### Notes

**Stability Release**

This release addresses a potential floating point exception in NRStatsEngine triggered by a race condition.

**ASIHttpRequest Improvement**

This release adds mobile-server correlation of HTTP requests when using the ASIHttpRequest library. Previously these requests would not be linked to the corresponding transaction in the application server view.
