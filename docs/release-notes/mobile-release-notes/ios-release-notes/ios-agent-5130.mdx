### Features

* Added a new `MobileBreadcrumb` custom event type that allows you to annotate the execution of your app, to help troubleshoot crashes and provide greater detail in Insights. Record this new event type with the method `+recordBreadcrumb:withAttributes:`.
* Added an additional `+recordCustomEvent:name:withAttributes` method that takes the event name as an optional parameter. This avoids the need to add a name attribute in the passed attribute set.
