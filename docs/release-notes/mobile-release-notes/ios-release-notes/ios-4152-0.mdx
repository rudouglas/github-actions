### Notes

#### Improvements

* Improved network instrumentation performance resulting from a change in the way we detect the network connection type, which also prevents the potential for a deadlock under high concurrency.
* The agent will raise an exception with detailed information in the event it detects a fatal conflict where another library interferes with our code instrumentation.

#### Fixes

* Resolves an issue with ASI instrumentation that could cause a crash when receiving certain network level errors.
* Resolves a deadlock scenario that could occur during certain high-load circumstances. 
* Fixes an issue where heavy network load could potentially cause the OS Reachability functionality to hang, forcing the OS to terminate the app on launch. 
* NewRelic.h was updated to correct syntax issues causing compiler warnings.
