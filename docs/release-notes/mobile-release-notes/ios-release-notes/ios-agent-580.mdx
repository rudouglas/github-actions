### Improvements

* Added support for control characters in insights data. Control characters will now be displayed by their common escaped character representation. e.g.: an 'end-of-text' control character will be displayed a '^C'.

This release was removed as compatibility issues were discovered. See [iOS agent release v5.8.1](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-581) notes for more details.
