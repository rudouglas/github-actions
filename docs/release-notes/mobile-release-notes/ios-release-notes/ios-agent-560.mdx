### Improvements

tvOS is now supported! The New Relic agent will now build and run on your tvOS apps with the same great features as the iOS agent! For more information, learn how to [install and configure the tvOS agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/tvos/tvos-installation-configuration).

### Fixes
