### Improvements

* Crash Report Upload Retry Limiting
  * Crash report upload retries will now be limited. This is to prevent crashes from being queued eternally.
* Platform Tracking
  * A new API, `+setPlatform:`, was added to `NewRelic.h`. This will allow bold users to set which platform their app is built with (for example, Unity, Xamarin, React, etc.). This will allow for additional features in the future.

### Fixes

* Insights API Improvements
  * `+recordEvent:withAttributes:` and `+setAttribute:withValue:` will no longer block the calling thread.
