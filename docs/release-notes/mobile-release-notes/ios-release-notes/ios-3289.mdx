### Notes

**Fixes**

* Fixes a sporadic crash triggered by xpc_mach_port activity in the application after a call to read thread CPU usage fails. Also appears as a crash triggered by the SCReachability system API.
* Fixes an issue where certain class inheritance hierarchies may cause a grandparent class's implementation of an instrumented method to be invoked multiple times.
* Fixes a crash related to enabling both Verbose mode and File Output mode in the New Relic SDK.
