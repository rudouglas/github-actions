### Improvements

* Adds IPv6 support to the iOS Agent. At WWDC this year, Apple announced they will be requiring IPv6 compatibility for all submitted apps at some point in the future.

### Fixes

* Fixes a crash that can occur when the app is backgrounded and the OS forcibly destructs the app while the agent was still active. This caused critical agent code to be unexpectedly destructed while data was still being processed.
