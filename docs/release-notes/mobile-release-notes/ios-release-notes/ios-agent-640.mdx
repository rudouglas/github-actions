### Fixes

* `+setMaxEventBufferTime` and `+setMaxEventPoolSize` now persist between background/foreground
* dSYM upload script has been improved. It is now better at finding and uploading dSYMs.

### Improvements

* Reduced agent size by removing old architectures. Note: with the removal of i386 the agent will no longer build with iPhone4S simulators (however, it will still run on iPhone4S devices.)

Note: This agent was built with Xcode10. It may be necessary to use Xcode10 for compatibility.
