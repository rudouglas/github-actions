### Improvements

* This release changes the way Monthly Active Unique devices (MAUs) are identified. The iOS agent now uses the iOS provided [identifierForVendor](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIDevice/identifierForVendor) from Apple to count unique devices.Â 

### Fixes

* Improved internal management of application termination, reducing occurrences of a specific agent crash.
* The agent will no longer harvest in the background if the app is executing background activities.
