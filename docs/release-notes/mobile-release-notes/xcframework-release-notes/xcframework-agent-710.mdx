### Improved attribute validation

The agent will no longer reject events containing invalid attributes. Attributes that fail basic event validation are pruned from the map of provided event attributes. We've also corrected an event creation error where attribute maps containing `null` keys would result in events with a subset of passed attributes.

This applies to `recordCustomEvent:withAttributes:` and `recordBreadcrumb:withAttributes:`.

### Other Notes

* This artifact was built using Xcode 12.0.1 with a minimum deployment target of iOS version 9.0
