## Changes

* New Relic Diagnostics installation zip now includes 64 bit binary for Mac OS.
* New Relic Infrastructure log collection now supports latest New Relic Infrastructure agent.
* Output of **Infra/Config/ValidateJMX**, when saved in `nrdiag-output.json` or `nrdiag-otuput.zip`, no longer contains JMX server credentials.
* **Java/Config/Validate** now has clearer help/explanation verbiage.
* When a New Relic Java agent configuration file is detected, **Java/Env/Process** now validates that there is at least one running java process that includes the New Relic Java agent flag.
* New Relic Diagnostics now uses the `diagnostics.service.newrelic.com` host for uploading support ticket attachments (when applicable), instead `support.newrelic.com`.
