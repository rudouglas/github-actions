### Notes

The New Relic app is even better with an improved home screen, displaying all your favorite services, hosts, mobile and browser apps, key transactions, and more. This enhanced landing page also allows you to search across services, apps and hosts!

### New features

* Added new home screen with favorite APM, Mobile, and Browser apps, Infrastructure hosts, key transactions, and plugin instances.
* Added search to the home screen, to quickly search across APM, Mobile, Browser apps, hosts and key transactions.

### Improvements

* Updated Infrastructure, when viewing a filter set, to show all hosts in the charts (up to 20) by default.
