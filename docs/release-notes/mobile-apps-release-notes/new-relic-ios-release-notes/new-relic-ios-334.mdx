### Notes

Introducing Radar

Radar provides analytic recommendations via cards which contains interesting, relevant, and actionable data about a specific service or the ecosystem as a whole. With four card types—Advice, Perspective, Events, and Celebrations—New Relic intelligently delivers insights to an individual, who can easily share the card with their team via a built-in integration with Slack.

Radar continues to be rolled out to customers paying at the Pro level or higher.
