### Notes

* Support for incident context from New Relic Radar -- a tool for faster orientation during an incident.
* Incident context provides faster orientation during an incident by detecting unusual behavior in your system and placing it alongside alert information.

### Improvements

* Improved login flow
* Improved behavior when searching through error trace attributes

### Bug fixes

* Fixed some issues where network failures or server issues would log you out. Now you can retry, instead of being logged out.
