## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

**Changed**: Starting in version 1.4.0, the Kubernetes integration is using Alpine Linux as the base image.

With Alpine the new image is smaller (16 MB instead of the previous 85 MB) and more secure. Alpine reduces the number of packages and libraries to the bare minimum, thus reducing the attack surface.
