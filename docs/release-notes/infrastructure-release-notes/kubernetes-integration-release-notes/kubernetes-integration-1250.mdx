## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

* **Added:** Support for OpenShift 4.4 and Kubernetes versions 1.17.X
* **Changed:** Upgraded Docker base image `newrelic/infrastructure-bundle` to `v1.4.1.`  
  For more information on the release please see the [New Relic Infrastructure Bundle release notes](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle/releases/tag/1.4.1).
* **Changed:** When retrieving control plane metrics from the API server to generate the K8sApiServerSample, the integration now uses by default the secure port `localhost:443` with the service account's bearer authentication. If the query on the secure port fails, it will fallback automatically to the non-secure one `localhost:8080`, this should preserve the same behavior as previous versions. If your cluster uses a different secure port to expose its metrics you can use [the configuration option `API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring#api-server) to specify it.
