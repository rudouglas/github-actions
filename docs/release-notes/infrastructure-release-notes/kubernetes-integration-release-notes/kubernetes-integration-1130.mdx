## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

* **Added**: samples for Statefulsets, Daemonsets, Endpoints and Services.
* **Added:** API Server metrics can now be queried using the secure port. Configure the port using the `API_SERVER_SECURE_PORT` environment variable. The ClusterRole has been updated to allow this query to happen.
* **Changed:** The integration now uses the infrastructure agent v1.8.32-bundle. For more information, refer to the [Infrastructure agent release notes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/) between versions v1.8.23 and v1.8.32.

  The bundle container contains a subset of [On-host integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) that are supported by New Relic. This also includes the ability to "Auto Discover" services running on Kubernetes in a similar way to our [Container auto-discovery](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery)
* **Changed:** The integration has been renamed from `nr-kubernetes` to `nri-kubernetes`.
