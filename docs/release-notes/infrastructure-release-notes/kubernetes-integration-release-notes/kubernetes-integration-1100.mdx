## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

**Added:** Node labels are now retrieved from the Kubernetes API and added to the `K8sNodeSample`. They can now be selected in the **Narrow Down Entities** section of the infrastructure alerts page to filter entities when using the `K8sNodeSample`, and can also be used on any NRQL statement when querying the `K8sNodeSample`. Ex:

```
FROM K8sNodeSample SELECT average(cpuUsedCoreMilliseconds) WHERE `label.kubernetes.io/role` = 'master'
```

By default, Information retrieved from the Kubernetes API is cached for 5 minutes. The cache time can be changed with the `API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL` environment variable.

**Changed:** The integration now uses the Infrastructure Agent v1.5.51. For more information, please refer to the [infrastructure agent release notes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/) between versions v1.5.31 and v1.5.51.
