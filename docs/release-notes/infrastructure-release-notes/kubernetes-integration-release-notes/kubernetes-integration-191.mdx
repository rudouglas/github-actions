## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

* **Fixed:** The unprivileged version of Kubernetes integration was running as root after a restart of the container due to [kubernetes/kubernetes#78308](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78308).
* **Fixed:** Autodiscovery cache directory permissions got changed from `644` to `744` in order to let the `nri-agent` user write inside. This change was necessary to release an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration.
