### New

* If you're using [Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html) to execute Lambda functions in AWS regions that are closer to your clients, you can get function execution location metadata by enabling the new **Collect [Lambda@Edge](mailto:Lambda@Edge) data** filter in the AWS CloudFront integration.
* The status of AWS VPC Network Interfaces and AWS VPC Peering Connections is now available, both as an inventory attribute (`status`) and as metrics metadata (`provider.status`).
* The launch type of AWS ECS services is now available as an inventory attribute (`launchType`) and as metrics metadata (`provider.launchType`). It contains the type of infrastructure on which tasks and services are hosted (`EC2` or `FARGATE`).

### Changes

* The default dashboard for AWS ELB has been updated: the previous chart named "Healthy vs. Unhealthy Hosts" has been replaced by a new chart named "ELBs with no healthy hosts", which shows more accurately the number of elastic load balancers that are not able to send traffic to any healthy target.
* The default dashboard for AWS ALB has been updated: the previous chart named "Healthy vs. Unhealthy Hosts" has been replaced by a new chart named "Target Groups with no healthy hosts", which shows more accurately the number of target groups that don't have any healthy target host to send traffic to.
