New Relic is now publishing [release notes for Cloud Integrations](https://docs-dev.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes). Stay up to date by subscribing to the [RSS feed](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/platform-release-notes/cloud-integrations-release-notes/feed).

### New

* The AWS Lambda integration can now be monitored in these additional regions: South America (Sao Paulo/sa-east-1), Asia Pacific (Mumbai/ap-south-1), Canada (Central/ca-central-1) and EU (London/eu-west-2).

### Changes

* The descriptions of DynamoDB table, region and global secondary index entity types have been updated in the [AWS DynamoDB monitoring integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-dynamodb-monitoring-integration) document.
* The list of specific permissions that are required to fetch data from AWS for each integration has been updated in the [Integrations and managed policies](http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies) document. Note that New Relic only recommends using a custom policy only if you're unable to use the [AWS `ReadOnlyAccess` managed policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies).
