### New

* The following integrations have been launched as beta:
  * \[Beta] [AWS Route 53 Resolver](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-route-53-monitoring-integration)
  * \[Beta] [Azure Express Route](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-express-route-monitoring-integration)

### Bug fixes

* There was a service name that was EMPTY in the Azure Cost Manager integration. We fixed it and now all services appear properly. The error was caused by a lag in the Azure query, a simple retry fixed the error.
