### Bug fixes

A bug affecting the **Service Plan** entity of the **Azure App Service** has been fixed. The following metrics have been renamed as a result:

* `sent` has been renamed `DiskQueueLength`
* `received` has been renamed `HttpQueueLength`

All other metrics stay the same.

For more information, see the [Azure App Service Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-app-service-monitoring-integration).
