### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that made the S3 integration stop fetching the `bucketSizeBytes` metric
* Fixed a bug that prevented the S3 integration from fetching data for some buckets in regions other than `us-east-1`

### Changes

* Extended inventory is now disabled by default for all newly configured integrations
* Decreased AWS IAM polling frequency to once every 60 minutes for all users. Default has been set to 60 minutes; more frequent polling is still possible by overriding the value
