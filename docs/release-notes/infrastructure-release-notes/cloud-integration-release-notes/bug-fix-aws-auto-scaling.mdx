### Bug fix

Some [AWS Auto Scaling](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-auto-scaling-monitoring-integration) entities had duplicate identifiers, causing some metadata to be missing or wrong. In order to fix this issue, New Relic has regenerated the internal `externalKey` attribute for all Auto Scaling entities in Insights events and Infrastructure inventory for this cloud integration.

This change doesn't have any impact either on the integration default dashboard provided by New Relic Infrastructure or on the Insights queries.

However, all entities related to AWS Auto Scaling will be created again in Inventory. Accordingly, once the fix is released in your account, you might see duplicated entities for 48 hours, until the old identifiers expire. This might also cause an unexpected volume of **Entity created** events.
