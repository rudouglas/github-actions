### New

The [account status dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/cloud-integrations-account-status-dashboard) for cloud-linked accounts introduces some significant changes:

* The **Account changes** chart lists any action that was performed on the linked cloud account configuration, from linking, renaming and enabling cloud services for monitoring, to modifying the polling intervals or any other data collection option.
* The charts in the dashboard have been reorganized to better understand API call usage, errors that affect New Relic collecting data, and changes to the integrations configuration.
* For Google Cloud-linked projects, the dashboard now includes the **Stackdriver calls** chart, which shows the amount of API calls that New Relic sends to the Google Stackdriver Monitoring API.
