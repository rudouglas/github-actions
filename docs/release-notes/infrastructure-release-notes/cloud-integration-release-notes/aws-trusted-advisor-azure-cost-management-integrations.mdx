### New

* **AWS Trusted Advisor integration**
  * New Relic now offers an integration with [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/). AWS establishes [limits for each service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in each account and region. Some examples are: _number of Auto Scaling groups_, _number of EBS active volumes_, and _number of EC2 elastic IP addresses_. AWS recommends watching these limits, and even allows you to enable automated actions and custom notifications. That data is now also available in New Relic.
  * For more information on how to enable the integration, check out the [integration documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-trusted-advisor-integration).
* **Azure Cost Management integration**
  * New Relic now offers a cloud integration with the [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cost-management/) service. It provides the accumulated costs in the billing period, grouped by cloud service, resource group, region and (if configured) custom tags.
