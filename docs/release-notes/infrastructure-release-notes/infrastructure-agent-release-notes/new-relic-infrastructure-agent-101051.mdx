### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Improvements

* Add new improved Windows Storage Sampler based on PDH instead of WMI. This new sampler is faster and more reliable; it is activated by default, to revert to the old one you can set the `legacy_storage_sampler` option to `true`.

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug where some inventory items could disappear.
* Fix bug with `strip_command_line=true` that could cause some processes to be discarded in the samples.
* Fix bug that prevented some inventory items from updating their state when asked for a full reset.
