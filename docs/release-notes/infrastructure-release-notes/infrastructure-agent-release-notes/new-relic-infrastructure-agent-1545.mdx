### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* Linux: Added additional checks to confirm the user ID to determine whether the agent is running as a root user.

### Changed

* Using a new endpoint for Agent identity retrieval to mitigate the hostname flipping issue. This change was introduced for the Windows Agent 1.5.37, and now is also active for the Linux Agent.
