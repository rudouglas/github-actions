### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) agent for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### Improvements

* Improved handling for configuration files syntax.
* Agent can recover more gracefully when inventory information is ill formed.
* lp.exe plugin (Windows Programs Inventory) significantly more performant.
* Entities (hosts) are less likely to get combined unexpectedly when starting Agent from AMIs or other images.
* Warns if you try to use "localhost" as the hostname.
* Network interface information captured as inventory.
