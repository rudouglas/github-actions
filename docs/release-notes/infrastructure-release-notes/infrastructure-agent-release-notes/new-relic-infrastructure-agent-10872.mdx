### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Linux and Windows release.

### Improvements

* Allow disabling inventory of SELinux modules in hosts where the associated command consumes too much CPU. Set `selinux_enable_semodule` configuration option to `false` to disable it while keeping the rest of SELinux plugin features.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that avoided updating the information of a Linux process when its command name changes at runtime, or when a new process starts with a PID that already existed for a previous process.
