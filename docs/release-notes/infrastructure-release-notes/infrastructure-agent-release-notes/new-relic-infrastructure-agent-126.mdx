### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Features

* Added the `dns_hostname_resolution` configuration option (default: `true`). If set to false, the agent won't use DNS-based hostname resolution and will ask directly to the operating system.
* Added `ignore_reclaimable` configuration option (Linux only), which considers reclaimable memory as part of the free memory (and not part of the used memory). Free memory will be is calculated as: `total - free - buffers - cached - sreclaimable`, independently of the `MemAvailable` report from the kernel.

### Improvements

* In cloud environments, the instance ID retrieval process is more solid during the agent startup. It also allows the agent to be spawned from VM snapshots.

### Changes

* Removed `total_cores` host metric.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused the `DiskMonitor` samples to show devices in the deny list (from the `file_devices_ignored` configuration option).
* Fixed Storage Sampler in 32-bit Windows agent.
* Reduced the incidence of hostname flipping in DNS-based hostname resolution.
* Fixed a bug that, in the Linux agent, removed the last character of the command line of some process samples.
* (Linux only) Fixed the used memory values in the System Samples, which in agent 1.2.1 were slightly different from the actual value.
* Fixed a problem that, when an environment configuration option had a wrong format, caused the rest of the environment variables to not be parsed.
