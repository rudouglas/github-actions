### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) agent for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release. Also note that the build number was "fast forwarded" to fix a version related bug.

### Bug fixes

* High cross platform I/O rate change numbers now reporting correct storage, network, and processes.
* Improved diagnostics when calculating CPU usage in certain scenarios where it would appear unusually large.
* Fixes handling of Inventory naming prefix.
