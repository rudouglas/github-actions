### Added

* [#155](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/issues/155) The Infrastructure agent now handles entities' registration errors the following way (Infrastructure SDK v4 protocol):
  * For request errors:
    * Connectivity failure or limit exceeded (429 or 503 status codes) will trigger a retry with an exponential backoff with a maximum backoff of 1 minute.
    * Other types of errors (including bad payload format) will be logged, and data will be discarded.
  * For successful requests (200 status code) containing:
    * Errors: The agent will discard related data.
    * Warnings will be logged.
* [#156](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/issues/156) The Infrastructure agent entity registration now batches requests with a maximum of 1000 entities and payloads of 1Mb per call.
* [#123](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/issues/123) The embedded telemetry API now splits DM submission by number of entities following requested driven contract limitations.
