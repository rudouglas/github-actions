### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* Command channel. Enables NR platform to trigger commands to agents via command-api HTTPS endpoint . See [further details](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-security/infrastructure-security#command-api).
* Added log entry for when initializing docker client fails: `unable to initialize docker client`.

### Bug fixes

* Disabled keep-alive on cloud metadata requests to avoid leaking open connections.
