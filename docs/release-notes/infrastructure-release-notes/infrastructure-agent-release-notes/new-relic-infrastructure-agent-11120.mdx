## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* The agent can now retrieve secrets from [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) when running [KV Secrets Engine - Version 1](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1/).
* [Log forwarder](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/forward-your-logs-using-new-relic-infrastructure-agent) entries now include `hostname` as an attribute.

### Changed

* Update nri-docker to [v1.2.0](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-docker/releases/tag/v1.2.0) (beta Fargate)

### Security fixes

* Fixed an issue that could cause secrets to leak into log warning messages when using [secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a log forwarder error that occurred when enabling `eventlog` sources.
* Fixed an issue that could cause the storage sampler to not return all mount points for a device.
* Avoid spamming the log when agent can't get a process path. This happened mostly when dealing with Windows system-level processes.
