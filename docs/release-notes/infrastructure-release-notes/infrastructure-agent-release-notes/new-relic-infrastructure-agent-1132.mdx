## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* [#126](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/issues/126) The embedded telemetry API, responsible for sending dimensional metrics, now limits the amount of queued entities. This feature tends to avoid memory consumption when metrics can not be submitted.
* Agent and on-host integrations are now supported on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal).

### Changed

* [#222](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/222) The built-in Docker integration has been updated to version 1.3.3. For more information, [see the nri-docker changelog](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-docker/releases/tag/v1.3.3).
* Log forwarder feature has updated Fluent Bit plugging to version [v1.6.3](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/releases/tag/v1.6.3) and Fluent Bit Output for New Relic to [v1.4.3](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/releases/tag/1.4.3).
