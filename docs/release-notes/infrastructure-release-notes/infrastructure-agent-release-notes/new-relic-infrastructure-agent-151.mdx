### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changed

* Improved `StorageSample` metrics performance.
  * Please refer to the [New Relic event data dictionary](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary) for a detailed description of them.

#### Windows only

> IMPORTANT: This version was deleted from the Windows repository to avoid causing issues on the platform.

* Improved hostname flipping issue mitigation using a new endpoint for agent identity retrieval.
  * Cases where a host flipping its hostname (because DNS lookup is not available or any other reasons) caused host entity identification to change (and some alerts to fail) should be mitigated, but some cases could still persist.
