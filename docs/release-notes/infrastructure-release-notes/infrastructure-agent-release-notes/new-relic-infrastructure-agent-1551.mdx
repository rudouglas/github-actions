### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changed

### Linux

* Better error handling for NFS support.
* HostInfo plugin to provide uptime for older distros.

### Bug fixes

* The agent will reuse network connections again. Since v1.3.18, the agent created a new connection on each metrics post. Not reusing the connections may lead metrics to be accumulated and submitted with long delays in systems where the connection establishment is slow.
