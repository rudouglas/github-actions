## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* The agent now logs `error` and `fatal` messages from integrations even when not running in verbose mode. This feature is only available to integrations configured using the V4 configuration format found in versions [1.8.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes/new-relic-infrastructure-agent-180) or higher of the agent.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where spaces in integration commands would sometimes get split incorrectly, causing the commands to fail.

### Changed

* The built-in Flex integration has been updated to version 1.3.0 For more information, [see the Flex changelog](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/releases)
* The built-in Docker integration has been updated to version 1.3.0. For more information, [see the nri-docker changelog](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-docker/releases)
