### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* Optional JSON log format (doc coming soon).

### Changed

* Startup info and errors are now logged into the log file since the beginning.
* Log messages prior to configuration being fully loaded.
* Improved error catching and logging on fatal failures.
* Improved log messages. Most of the messages are now static, not inlined with context values, so messages are more easily filterable/greppable, and context fields are provided attached.

Example old message:

```
Containerized agent found with container id VALUE
```

Example new message:

```
Containerized agent found in container
      containerID: VALUE
```
