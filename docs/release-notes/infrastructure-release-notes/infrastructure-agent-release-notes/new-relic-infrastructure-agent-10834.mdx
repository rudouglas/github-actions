### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Linux and Windows release.

### Improvements

* Factor built-in integration filters noisy `puppet_agent_pid` change events.
* Enhanced information available when running in verbose logging mode to help find StorageSample issues with unsupported file systems.
* StorageSamples are now collected for `vxfs` filesystem on Linux.
* Windows: `svchost.exe` processes will show more context info in their process names (akin to TaskMgr.exe behavior).
* Windows: Initial support for optional `enabled_elevated_process_priv` (set to `true` to use) which captures more process information if the account being used to run the agent has the `SeDebugPrivilege` right in its local policy.

### Bug fixes

* StorageSample I/O calculations that show percentage should now display a ceiling of 100%.
* Agent will better detect when a PID is reused on Linux and Windows, and refresh any cached information about that process.
* Windows: built-in integration `lp.exe` (List Packages), has been re-written to use the latest On Host Integration SDK and protocol. The original integration was not working reliably and could litter logs with warnings.
