### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released, including some improvements and bug fixes. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Improvements

* Added `max_procs` configuration option to specify the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value can help to distribute the load between different cores. Default value is 1. If value is set to -1 then it will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If that variable is not set then the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host.
* Added `ignore_system_proxy` configuration option to make the Agent ignore the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`

### Bug fixes

* Fixed errors with https values on the `proxy` configuration option
