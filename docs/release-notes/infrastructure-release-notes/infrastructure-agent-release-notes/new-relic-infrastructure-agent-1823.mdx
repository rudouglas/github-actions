### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Features

* Inventory body reporting the agent entity ID.

### Bug fixes

* Supporting Overlay File Systems in the storage samples. Before agent 1.8.23, a device mapped from multiple overlay folders might not be reported as the parent partition but as any folder mounting it. Now the agent reports the parent mount folder.
* Removed confusing warning log message from the integrations' engine ignoring legacy configuration files.
