## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* The agent now adds Alibaba Cloud metadata, when available, to all data collected.
* When the agent runs in verbose mode, all integrations that support it now also run in verbose mode.
* When querying [EC2 Instance Metadata Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) the agent now uses Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2) for all requests. For more information on why you should use IMDSv2, [see this AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/) .
