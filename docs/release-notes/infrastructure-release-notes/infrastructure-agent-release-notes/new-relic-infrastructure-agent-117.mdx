version: 1.1.4

### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changes

* Limited the inventory source field to 100 characters. This would only affect custom integrations with atypically long source names.

### Improvements

* For users with [Facter](https://docs.puppet.com/facter) enabled, we provide the `facter_home_dir` configuration option that allows setting the `HOME` environment variable for Facter. If unset, it defaults to the current user's home directory.

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug introduced in version 1.1.4 that prevented the agent running after a system restart.
