### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changes

* Added support for defining integration arguments as environment variables in the configuration file. When defining the value of an argument in the integration configuration file with something that starts with `$` (for example `hostname: $HOSTNAME`) the agent will try to expand the environment variable.
* Added internal configuration options for use in Kubernetes.
