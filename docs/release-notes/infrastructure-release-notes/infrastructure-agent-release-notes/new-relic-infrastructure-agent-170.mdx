### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Features

* Improved host shutdown detection in Windows and Linux (systemd only). This will add a new inventory source called `agent/shutdown_status` with the value `Running` or `Shutdown` and a corresponding event in events
  * In Windows, the Agent will create a NamedPipe to communicate between the service process and the agent process. The NamedPipe is only writable for admin users
* Removed some warning when running the agent
* Fixed issue where enabling "Verbose Logs" was not working in some cases
