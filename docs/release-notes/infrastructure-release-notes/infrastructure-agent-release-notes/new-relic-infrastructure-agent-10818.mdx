### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### New features

* Adds support for latest versions of the Infrastructure Integration SDK.
* Adds support for identifying the Google Cloud Platform instance ID (NOTE: all the existent GCP nodes will be renamed as now we're adding the gcp prefix in the id. This may trigger false-positive host not reporting alerts)

### Bug fixes

* Fixes bug where absolute values specified in custom integration command lines would not be recognized.
* Fixes possible race condition when trying to collect storage metrics that could lead to a panic error and crash the agent.
* Fixes problem on Windows where agent would try to read the deprecated user_data folder and cause an error.
