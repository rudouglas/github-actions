### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released, including some improvements and bug fixes. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Security Update

* A security update for the Windows Infrastructure agent corrects an issue where the agent may execute privileged binaries in the system path. Security bulletin [NR18-11](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-11).

### Improvements

* Add `override_hostname` and `override_hostname_short` configuration options, to disable hostname resolution and setting directly these values. Documentation [available here](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/wrong-host-name-reported).

### Bug fixes

* Fix errors with https values on the `proxy` configuration option. More information can be found in the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/troubleshooting/https-proxy-configuration-missing).
* Fix 'error resolving entity identity' errors in log.
* Fix some hosts reporting localhost as full hostname.
* Fix some 0-value samples not being reported, and appeared as "No value" in the UI.
