## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Security fixes

* In Linux, at startup, the agent ensures it has ownership of the integrations temporary data folder, **/tmp/nr-integrations/**. This ensures only the agent/integrations can write into it negating potential abuse that could result in Denial/Degradation of Service.
