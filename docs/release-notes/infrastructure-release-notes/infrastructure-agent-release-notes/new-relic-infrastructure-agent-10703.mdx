### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### Improvements

* Reduce log noise for short lived processes and built-in modules that are not active on the current platform.
* Agent can be run with empty config files or no config file at all (when using environment variables for necessary configuration options like your license key).
* Adds configuration option `log_to_stdout` (default is true). Set this option to `false` to restrict log output to a file only when `log_file` is configured.

### Bug fixes

* Fix so no extra command line elements are added when creating an On-Host Integration with no parameters using Python.
