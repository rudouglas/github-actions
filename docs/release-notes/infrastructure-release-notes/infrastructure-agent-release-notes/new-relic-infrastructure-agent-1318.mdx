### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Bug fixes

* When the configuration variable `startup_connection_retries` is set to -1, the Agent will keep checking forever the connectivity at startup to avoid `CrashLoopBackOff` states in K8S in case of failures. 'startup_connection_retry_time' has been removed and now the Agent uses an exponential backoff algorithm.
* Improve the exponential backoff algorithm the Agent uses when posting metrics fails due to a non 2xx request response.
* Filter duplicated device entries in the `StorageSample`.
