See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Linux and Windows release.

### Improvements

* Prevent multiple instances of an integration from running at the same time.

### Bug fixes

* Fixes issues with possibly corrupt JSON stored in the delta cache due to agent shutting down uncleanly.
* Security Bulletin [NR18-05](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-05): Fixes issue introduced in version 1.0.822 where command lines that included arguments that themselves had paths in them would trip up the parser and not properly strip out the command.
