## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* Integrations can now be enabled or disabled via environment variables. This feature is only valid from version [1.8.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180), since it requires the V4 configuration format.

Example:

```
integrations:
  - name: my-integration
    when:
      env_exists:
        MY_ENV_VAR: true
    interval: 15s
```

### Changed

* Improvements in the agent internals to better support ECS environments.
