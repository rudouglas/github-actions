### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* Improved [auto discovery](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery) of ports:
  * If a container exposes ports 80 and 443, then `${discovery.port}` or `${discovery.ports.0}` would equal to port `80` and `${discovery.ports.1}` to `443`. As ports are are sorted in ascending order, port `8080` would have been assigned to number three and so on.
  * Ports are also tagged by port type (usually TCP): `${discovery.ports.tcp}` and `${discovery.ports.tcp.0}` would equal to `80` and `${discovery.ports.tcp.1}` to `443`.

### Bug fixes

* On Windows, the agent can now report processes even when their command line cannot be gathered. The [commandLine](/attribute-dictionary/processsample/commandline) attribute will be empty in those cases.
