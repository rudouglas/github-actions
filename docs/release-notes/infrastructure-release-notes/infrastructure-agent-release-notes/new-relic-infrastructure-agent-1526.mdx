A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Windows only

* Previous agent version 1.5.0 got flagged by Windows Defender. We found it was a false positive. This version proved to pass Defender test, but could still get flagged by Defender on some systems.
* Improved `StorageSample` metrics performance. Please refer to the [New Relic event data dictionary](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary) for a detailed description of them.
