### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Features

* Host shutdown detection in Windows and Linux (systemd only).
* As part of a feature to reduce Host Not Reporting alerts, the Agent will (try to) detect if a Host is being shutdown. There will be a new Inventory entry, agent/shutdown_status, with a value of either Running or Shutdown that will later be used by Alerts to decide if a HNR alert should be triggered or not.
* Verbose logging enablement from newrelic-infra-ctl for Windows.
* Improved agent identification
