## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* Agent version is now logged in non-verbose mode, too.

### Fixed

* A missing parsers configuration file for the log forwarder has been restored to the Windows installer.
* The `mountInfo` / `diskstats` mapping for fetching LVM volumes' I/O stats has been fixed; it can still fail for older systems that lack a `mountInfo` file and use custom names for their LVM volumes.
* A bug in the log forwarder that prevented some `tcp` and `syslog` URIs to be parsed correctly has been fixed.

### Changed

* The built-in Flex integration has been updated to version 1.1.2. For more information, [see the Flex changelog](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
* The built-in Docker integration has been updated to version 1.2.1. For more information, [see the Docker integration changelog](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
