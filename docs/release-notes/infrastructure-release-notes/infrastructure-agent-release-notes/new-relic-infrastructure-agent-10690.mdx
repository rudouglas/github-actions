### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### Improvements

* Better on-host integrations SDK support including pre-creating some require directories, skipping ill-configured integrations, and fixes around how the command for an integration definition is parsed.

### Bug fixes

* Optimization fixes for the amount of time needed to check whether on a cloud instance. Should try once and timeout quickly. Optional `disable_cloud_metadata` can be used if you need to force turn off collection of cloud-specific metadata.
