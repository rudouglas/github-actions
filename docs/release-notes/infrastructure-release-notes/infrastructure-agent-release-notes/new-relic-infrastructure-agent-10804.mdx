### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### Bugs

* Disk free/used percent now matches output from `df -h` on Linux.
* Docker container metadata now updates on a one-minute schedule. This will capture container changes such as restarts or container name changes.
* Payload compression for outgoing data will be turned on for all agents. To turn off compression, set the config setting `payload_compression_level` to 0.
