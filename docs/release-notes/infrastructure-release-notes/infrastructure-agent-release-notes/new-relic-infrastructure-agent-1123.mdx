## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* [a7b17c6](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/commit/a7b17c60b4ba75291ab9cf6a71d62a3c929f0584) Inventory data collection could now work in a non-blocking manner: We now allocate a configurable inventory queue in the same fashion as metrics/events. This feature is disabled under a [feature-flag](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/7).

### Fixed

* [71cc96b](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/commit/71cc96b0d84c65bdfd194710c4a1397e609ddf23) Fixed issue in the storage sampler where we reported only one mount point for each device.

### Changed

* [14bcf94](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/commit/14bcf94b65f2c539d83e8502f0d6cfa1cb92cd1c) The built-in Docker integration has been updated to version 1.3.2. For more information, [see the nri-docker changelog](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-docker/releases/tag/v1.3.2)
