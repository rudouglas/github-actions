### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Bugfixes

* Fixed crash behaviour while stopping the agent under certain circumstances. Ie, containerised agent service stop could trigger a crash dumping a trace.
  * Crash on stop should not be harmful for the agent itself or remaining data, but a non zero exit code and/or crash backtrace output might affect 3rd parties.
