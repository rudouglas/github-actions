## Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* The Log Forwarder now adds additional validation and information logging when parsing the logging configuration files.
* Example configuration for the Log Forwarder has been added to the `logging.d` directory in the Infrastructure agent.
* When the Log Forwarder is started it will now only read YAML configuration files (\*.yml and \*.yaml).

For more information on the Log Forwarder, see [Forward your logs using New Relic Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/forward-your-logs-using-new-relic-infrastructure).

### Fixed

* The Log Forwarder can now be started even if the hostname cannot be resolved.

### Changed
