### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Features

New [integrations engine](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180), which coexists with the previous engine for backwards-compatibility and smoother transition. Featuring:

* Simpler setup of integrations, with fewer files and fewer mandatory properties. In some cases, you only have to set the integration name to enable it.
* Flexible configuration of integrations via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files.
* Ability to group different integrations in the same configuration file.
* Hot reload of integrations, so you can add a new integration or change its configuration without needing to restart the Infrastructure agent.
* Timeouts when an integration does not respond before a user-specified time. The integration process is killed and restarted. This can also be disabled.
* Smooth migration from the old integrations engine.

Please read the documentation about [Infrastructure integration configuration file specifications for agent v1.8.0 or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180) for a complete description of how to start using the new integrations engine, as well as a detailed description and examples of the new configuration options.
