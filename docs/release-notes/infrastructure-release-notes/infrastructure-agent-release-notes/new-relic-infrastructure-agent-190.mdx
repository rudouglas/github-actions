### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Features

* Added IPv6 support during hostname resolution via DNS.
* In verbose mode, more detailed logging during hostname resolution.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug from the new [integrations' engine added in the version 1.8.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180), which caused any JSON line larger than 64 KB to be ignored. This does not affect to the integrations that are configured with the format prior to 1.8.0, which is still supported.
* Fixed [`${config.path}` replacement](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180#config) in new integrations' configuration file. When an integration configuration contained a `config` or `config_file_template` section and the `${config.path}` variable was used in an environment variable or command-line argument, the correct path was set only during the first execution, remaining the same for the rest of executions, even if the path changes.
* Fixed Linux packaging metadata.
  * Updated the `Vendor` field from "&lt;jenkins@401c99d99b5f>" to "New Relic, Inc.", fixing the problem that some customers where having on SLES v11.2 Suse, or higher, due to the "repository vendor stickiness", which protects apps from accidentally replacing stable versions of installed packages with experimental versions from a different repository when updating.
  * Added extra metadata fields: `License`, `Maintainer`, `URL`, `Description`, `Distribution` and `Summary`
