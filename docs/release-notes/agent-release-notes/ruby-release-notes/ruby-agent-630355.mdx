## v6.3.0

* **Official Rails 6.0 support**

  This version of the agent has been verified against the Rails 6.0.0 release.

  As ActiveRecord 4, 5, and 6 use the same New Relic instrumentation, the `disable_active_record_4` and `disable_active_record_5` settings in NewRelic.yml are being deprecated in favor of the new `disable_active_record_notifications`. This new setting will affect the instrumentation of ActiveRecord 4, 5, and 6. The deprecated settings will be removed in a future release.
* **Bugfix for `newrelic deployments` script**

  For applications housed in the EU, the `newrelic deployments` script included with previous versions of the agent would fail with the following message: `Deployment not recorded: Application does not exist.` This is because the script would attempt to send the deployment notification to the US region. The deployment script now sends deployments to the correct region.
* **Faster ActiveRecord connection resolution**

  This version of the agent uses the faster ActiveRecord connection resolution that Rails 6.0 uses, even on previous versions of Rails. Thanks to Callum Jones for the contribution!
* **Support non-ascii characters in hostnames**

  Previous versions of the agent would frequently log warnings like: `log writing failed. "\xE2" from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8` if the hostname contained a non-ascii character. This version of the agent will no longer log these warnings. Thanks to Rafael Petry for the contribution!
