## v3.18.1

* Ensure Mongo aggregate queries are properly obfuscated

  Instrumentation for the Mongo 2.x driver had a bug where the `pipeline` attribute of Mongo aggregate queries was not properly obfuscated. Users who have sensitive data in their `aggregate` queries are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version of the agent. Users who are unable to upgrade are encouraged to turn off query collection using by setting `mongo.capture_queries` to false in their newrelic.yml files.

  This release fixes [New Relic Security Bulletin NR17-03](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr17-03).
* Early access Redis 4.0 instrumentation

  Our Redis instrumentation has been tested against Redis 4.0.0.rc1.
