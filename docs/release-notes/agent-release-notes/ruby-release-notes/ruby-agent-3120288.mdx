### Notes

* Flexible capturing of attributes

  The Ruby agent now allows you more control over exactly which request parameters and job arguments are attached to transaction traces, traced errors, and Insights events. For details, see:

  [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/ruby-agent-attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/ruby-agent-attributes)
* Fixed missing URIs in traces for retried Excon requests

  If Excon's idempotent option retried a request, the transaction trace node for the call would miss having the URI assigned. This has been fixed.
* Capturing request parameters from rescued exceptions in Grape

  If an exception was handled via a rescue_from in Grape, request parameters were not properly set on the error trace. This has been fixed. Thanks to Ankit Shah for helping us spot the bug.
