### Notes

* Bugfix for Manual Browser Instrumentation

  There was a previous bug that required setting both `rum.enabled: false` and `browser.auto_instrument: false` to completely disable browser monitoring. An attempt to fix this in 4.7.0 resulted in breaking manual browser instrumentation. Those changes have been reverted. We will revisit this issue in an upcoming release.
