## v5.3.0

* Distributed tracing

  Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.

  Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the [transition guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing) before you enable this feature.

  To enable distributed tracing, set the`distributed_tracing.enabled` configuration option to `true`.
