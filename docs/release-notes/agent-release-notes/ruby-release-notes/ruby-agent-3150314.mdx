### Notes

* Rails 5 support

  This release includes experimental support for Rails 5 as of 5.0.0.beta2. Please note that this release does not include any support for ActionCable, the WebSockets framework new to Rails 5.
* Don't include extension from single format GrapeÂ API transaction names

  Starting with Grape 0.12.0, an API with a single format no longer declares methods with `.:format`, but with an extension such as `.json`. Thanks Daniel Doubrovkine for the contribution!
* Fix warnings about shadowing outer local variable when running tests

  Thanks Rafael Almeida de Carvalho for the contribution!
* Check config first for Rails middleware instrumentation installation

  Checking the config first avoids issues with mock classes that don't implement `VERSION`. Thanks Jesse Sanford for the contribution!
* Remove a trailing whitespace in the template for generated newrelic.yml

  Thanks Paul Menzel for the contribution!
* Reference external resources in comments and readme with HTTPS

  Thanks Benjamin Quorning for the contribution!
