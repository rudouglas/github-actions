## v5.5.0

* Bugfix for `perform` instrumentation with curb gem

  Use of curb's `perform` method now no longer results in nil headers getting returned.
* Bugfix for parsing Docker container IDs

  The agent now parses Docker container IDs correctly regardless of the cgroup parent.
* Use lazy load hooks for ActiveJob instrumentation

  In some instances the ActiveJob instrumentation could trigger ActiveJob to load before it was initialized by Rails. This could result in configuration changes not being properly applied. The agent now uses lazy load hooks which fixes this issue.
* Documentation improvement

  The `config.dot` diagram of the agent's configuration settings no longer includes the deleted `developer_mode` option. Thanks to Yuichiro Kaneko for the contribution!
