## v3.16.0

* Official Rails 5.0 support

  This version of the agent has been verified against the Rails 5.0.0 release.
* Early access Action Cable instrumentation

  The Ruby agent instruments Action Cable channel actions and calls to ActionCable::Channel#Transmit in Rails 5. Feedback is welcome!
* Obfuscate queries from `oracle_enhanced` adapter correctly

  This change allows the `oracle_enhanced` adapter to use the same obfuscation as `oracle` adapters. Thanks Dan Drinkard for the contribution!
* Make it possible to define a newrelic_role for deployment with Capistrano 3

  Thanks NielsKSchjoedt for the contribution!
* Retry initial connection to New Relic in Resque master if needed

  Previously, if the initial connection to New Relic in a monitored Resque master process failed, the agent would not retry, and monitoring for the process would be lost. This has been fixed, and the agent will continue retrying in its background harvest thread until it successfully connects.
