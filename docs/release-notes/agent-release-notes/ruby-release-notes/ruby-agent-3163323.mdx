## Notes

* Add `:trace_only` option to `notice_error` API

  Previously, calling `notice_error` would record the trace, increment the error count, and consider the transaction failing for Apdex purposes. This method now accepts a `:trace_only` boolean option which, if true, will only record the trace and not affect the error count or transaction.
* HTTP.rb support

  The agent has been updated to add instrumentation support for the HTTP gem, including Cross Application Tracing. Thanks Tiago Sousa for the contribution!
* Prevent redundant Delayed::Job instrumentation installation

  This change was to handle situations where multiple Delayed::Worker instances are being created but Delayed::Job has already been instrumented. Thanks Tony Brown for the contribution!
