### Notes

* Bugfix for uninitialized constant `NewRelic::Agent::ParameterFiltering`

  Users in some environments encountered a `NameError: uninitialized constant NewRelic::Agent::ParameterFiltering` from the Rails instrumentation while running v3.12.x of the Ruby agent. This issue has been fixed.
* Rake task instrumentation

  The Ruby agent now provides opt-in tracing for Rake tasks. If you run long jobs via Rake, you can get all the visibility and goodness of New Relic that your other background jobs have. For more information, see [Rake instrumentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/frameworks/rake-instrumentation).
* Redis instrumentation

  Redis operations will now show up on the Databases tab and in transaction traces. By default, only command names will be captured; to capture command arguments, set `transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments` to `true` in your configuration. For more information, see [Redis instrumentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/frameworks/redis-instrumentation).
* Fix for over-obfuscated SQL Traces and PostgreSQL

  An issue with the agent obfuscating column and table names from Slow SQL Traces when using PostgreSQL has been resolved.
* Rubinius 2.5.8 VM metric renaming support

  Rubinius 2.5.8 changed some VM metric names and eliminated support for total allocated object counters. The agent has been updated accordingly.
* Fix agent attributes with a value of false not being stored

  An issue introduced in v3.12.1 prevented attributes (like those added with `add_custom_attributes`) from being stored if their value was false. This has been fixed.
