### Notes

* Improved transaction names for Sinatra

  The agent will now use `sinatra.route` for transaction names on Sinatra 1.4.3+, which sets it in the request environment. This gives names that closer resemble the routes defined in the Sinatra DSL. Thanks to Brian Phillips for the suggestion!
* Bugfix for error flag on transaction events

  There was an issue causing the error flag to always be set to false for Insights transaction events that has been fixed.
* Official support for Sidekiq 4

  The Ruby agent now officially supports Sidekiq 4.
* Additional attributes collected

  The agent now collects the following information in web transactions: `Content-Length` HTTP response and `Content-Type` HTTP request headers.
