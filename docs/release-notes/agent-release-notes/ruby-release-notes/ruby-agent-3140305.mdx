## Notes

* **pruby** marshaller removed

  The deprecated pruby marshaller has now been removed; the `marshaller` config option now only accepts `json`. Customers still running Ruby 1.8.7/REE must add the `json` gem to their Gemfile, or (preferably) upgrade to Ruby 1.9.3 or higher.
* Log dates in ISO 8601 format

  The agent will now log dates in ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`) format, instead of `MM/DD/YY`.
* Additional attributes collected

  The agent now collects the following information in web transactions: `Accept`, `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Content-Length` HTTP request headers, HTTP request method, and `Content-Type` HTTP response header.
* `TransactionErrors` reported for APM error advanced analytics

  With this release, the agent reports `TransactionError` events. These new events power the beta feature Advanced Analytics for APM errors. The error events are also available today through New Relic Insights.

  Advanced Analytics for APM errors lets you see all of your errors, with granular detail. Filter and group by any attribute to analyze them. Take action to resolve issues through collaboration.

  For more information, see [View APM errors and error traces](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/view-apm-errors-error-traces).
