## v6.1.0

* Performance monitoring on Kubernetes

  This release adds Transaction event attributes that provide context between your Kubernetes cluster and services. For details on the benefits, see this [blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/monitoring-application-performance-in-kubernetes/).
* Bugfix for Bunny instrumentation when popping empty queues

  When a customer calls `Bunny::Queue#pop` on an empty queue, Bunny returns a `nil` value. Previous Ruby Agent versions raised a `NoMethodError` when trying to process this result. Now, the agent correctly skips processing for `nil` values. Thanks to Matt Campbell for the contribution.
