## New Features

* Added a configurable-length span queue to Infinite Tracing: infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size.

  The queue length can be modified to balance the needs of keeping full traces against trade-off of memory usage and CPU overhead in a high-throughput application.

## Improvements

* Updated remaining /api unit tests to use tap API.
* Updated @grpc/grpc-js to v1.0.3.

## Fixes

* Fixed issue where API.instrumentLoadedModule could throw an exception when it failed.

  Error details will now be caught and logged.
* Resolved non-proxy minimist security warnings by bumping dependencies.

  These updates only impact development dependencies. Thank you to @devfreddy for the contribution.

  * Updated minimist sub-deps to resolve most related security warnings.
  * Updated tap to resolve remaining tap security warnings.
  * Updated @newrelic/proxy.
