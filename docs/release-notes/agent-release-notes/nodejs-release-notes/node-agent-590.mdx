### New Features

* `serverless_mode` feature flag is now enabled by default.
* Added `instrumentLoadedModule` method to the API, allowing end-users to manually apply an instrumentation to a loaded module. Useful for cases where some module needs to be loaded before newrelic

### Improvements

* Removed older versions of Cassandra from versioned tests
* For debug/test runs, shimmer will now cleanup the \_\_NR_shim property on instrumented methods. This leftover property did not result in any negative behaviors but cleaning up for thoroughness and to prevent potential confusion.
* Fixes `recordMiddleware` promise parenting for certain cases where child segments are created within resolving middleware `next()` promises.
