### Notes

Express instrumentation has been fundamentally reworked.

This refactor includes a few bug fixes around error handling and transaction naming, as well as optional higher resolution traces.

Setting `feature_flag.express_segments` to true in the agent config will make the agent report the amount of time spent in each individual middleware per request

### Fixes

The agent will not report errors handled in an error handler it is monitoring - this is more in line with how the agent does error handling in other contexts.

The agent will now name transactions correctly when an application responds from a middleware.
