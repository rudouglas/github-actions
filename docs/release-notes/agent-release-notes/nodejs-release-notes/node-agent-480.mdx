### Improvements

* Implemented enforcement of `max_payload_size_in_bytes` config value.

  Any payload during the harvest sequence that exceeds the configured limit will be discarded.
* Added JSON-formatted output to benchmarks to enable automated benchmark comparison.
* Updated the benchmark runner to measure specifically userland CPU overhead.
* Added DatastoreShim benchmarks.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed MongoDB instrumentation for driver versions greater than 3.0.6.

  Mongo 3.0.6 removed metadata the Agent relied upon to instrument the driver. This fixes that by going back to the old method of manually listing all objects and methods to instrument.
* Updated MySQL versioned tests to run against the latest release.
