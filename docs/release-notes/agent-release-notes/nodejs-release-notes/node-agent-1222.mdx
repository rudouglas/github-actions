### Notes

* Removed client support of the RC4 stream cipher for communicating with the New Relic servers.

  The RC4 cipher is considered unsafe and is generally being deprecated.
* Fix for logging version number in Express instrumentation. Thanks @tregagnon.

  When an unsupported version of Express is detected, we log a message that contains the Express version number. The version is a string and was being logged as a number, resulting in NaN in the log message.
* Agent is now more safe when recording memory stats.

  Previously, the agent would crash the process as it was gathering memory usage information (i.e. when process.memoryUsage threw an error). This defect is now guarded against with a try-catch.
