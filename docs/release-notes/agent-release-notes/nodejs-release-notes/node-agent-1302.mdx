### New features

* Added instrumentation of the param() function in Express.

  The agent will now create metrics and transaction segments when the Express param() function is called as a part of a route. This also fixes an issue with transaction naming when the HTTP response is ended within a param() method.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue with naming Express transactions that result in 404 errors.

  Previously transactions were not always correctly normalized for URLs that caused 404 errors. The transactions will now always be reported with the same normalized name (e.g. "get /").
* Fixed instrumentation of Express v4.0 - v4.5.

  Previously transactions were not correctly named on older versions of Express 4.

### Improvements

* Minor upates to logging.
