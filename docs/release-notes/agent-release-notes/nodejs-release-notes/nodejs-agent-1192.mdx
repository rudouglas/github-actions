### Notes

* Fixed an issue with Error tracing

  Previously the agent could sometimes cause issues with user serialization of error Ã‚objects after they passed through the error tracing code.
* MongoDB cursor count method is now instrumented

  The `count` method on MongoDB cursors is now instrumented. Previously, count would not be included in transaction traces.
* Fixed a typo in NEWS.md

  Previously the release notes for v1.19.1 were included as notes for 1.19.0. This has now fixed thanks to @bruun
