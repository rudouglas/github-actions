## Improvements

* Bumped `@newrelic/aws-sdk` to `v1.1.1` from `v1.0.0`. [https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-aws-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-aws-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) Notable improvements include:

  * Added official support for API promise calls, fixing two critical bugs.
  * Added check before applying instrumentation to avoid breaking for very old versions.
* Added `bindPromise()` to `Shim` prototype for direct usage by instrumentation. Previously, `_bindPromise()` was a private function in the `Shim` module.
* Updated language in agent to be in line with New Relic Standards.

## Fixes

* Fixed spelling in configuration error. Thank you to David Ray (@daaray) for the contribution.
* Fixed long-log truncation issue in Serverless mode.
