### Improvements

* Improved documentation for `newrelic.start*Transaction` and `TransactionHandle.`

  Formatting for the `startWebTransaction` and `startBackgroundTransaction` methods was fixed and documentation for the `TransactionHandle` class which `getTransaction` returns was added.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed parsing the table name from SQL queries.

  Quotes around the table name are now stripped after parsing the query and before constructing the metrics.
* Fixed unhandled rejection error caused by `ioredis` instrumentation.
