### Bug fixes

* Stop collecting URL parameters from the HTTP referer header

  The Node agent collects the request headers during an error trace to help determine the root cause of problems. The referer header is the URI that identifies the address of the webpage that linked to the resource being requested. It is possible that the referer URI may contain sensitive information in the request query parameters. New Relic has found that the query parameters are not properly stripped during the error trace. This update fixes this by stripping the query parameters from the referer in the request header before sending this data to New Relic.

  This release fixes [New Relic Security Bulletin NR17-01](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr17-01).

### Improvements

* Improved logging of modules that did not get instrumented.
