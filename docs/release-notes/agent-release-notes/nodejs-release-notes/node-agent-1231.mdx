### Notes

* `newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader()` API now includes the full transaction name.

  Previously, the agent would use a fragment of the transaction name, causing Browser Monitoring transactions and APM transactions to not be cross linked. This change makes the cross linking work correctly.
