### Features

* Filesystem interactions are now recorded in metrics

  The time spent in filesystem functions during a transaction will now be displayed in the [transaction overview](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-dashboard#tx_viewing) page per operation.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug with error handling.

  Previously the agent could crash applications in certain situations where `null` was thrown rather than an `Error` object.
