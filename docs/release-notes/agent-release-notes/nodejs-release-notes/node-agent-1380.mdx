### Improvements

* We're excited to announce the addition of a new Node VMs page to the UI that provides a curated view of the cpu, memory, garbage collection, and event loop metrics that we have added over the past several releases of the node agent and native-metrics module.

  For more information, see [our documentation.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/node-vms-statistics-page)
* Added instrumentation of When.js promise library.

  Previously, the transaction state could get lost when multiple promises resolved close to each other.
* Fixed name of environment variable in error message when configuration file cannot be found. Thanks to @Maubic for the contribution!
* Updated tests to work with the latest version of Node 7.
