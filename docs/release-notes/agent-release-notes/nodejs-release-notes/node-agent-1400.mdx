### New features

* Node v8 is officially supported with the exception of `async`/`await`.

  Support for the new [`async/await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) keywords is coming in a future release. Until this support is added, New Relic does not support and highly discourages using the Node.js agent with applications that utilize `async`/`await`, as it could result in transaction state loss and data being mixed between transactions.

### Fixes

* Fixed issues related to changes in the core networking modules that resulted in transaction state loss. Also instrumented new asynchronous API methods in crypto and [inspector](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.0.0/docs/api/inspector.html).
