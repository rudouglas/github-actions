### New features

* Added [@newrelic/koa](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-koa) as a dependency.

  This introduces instrumentation for Koa v2.0.0 or higher. It will be treated as first-party instrumentation within the agent, but publishing it as a separate module allows it to be installed independently according to users' needs.

### Improvements

* Refactored instrumentation hooks to work with modules.

  With this change it is now possible to link against external instrumentation modules.
