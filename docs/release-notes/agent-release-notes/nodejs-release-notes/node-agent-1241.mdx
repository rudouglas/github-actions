### New features

* Error totals are now reported.

  The agent now reports metrics that reflect the total number of errors that have occurred in web and background transactions.

### Bug fixes

* Disabling SSL no longer requires the setting of a port.

  Previously, the agent required changing `port` in the config to `80` when disabling SSL. The agent will now default to port 80 if a port is not supplied and SSL is turned off.
* Logging functions have been improved.

  The agent will now properly log error stack traces and can rate limit logging messages. To aid in debugging we have provided more logging about the public API.
