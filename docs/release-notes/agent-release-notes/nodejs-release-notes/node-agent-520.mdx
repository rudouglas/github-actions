### New features

* Added Neptune to the known database names.

### Improvements

* Updated log messages for missing configuration files to point at the base configuration.

  Previously the log messages pointed at an internal file defining default values for every configuration.
* Upgraded to `@newrelic/native-metrics` v4.
* Removed outdated config files.
* Removed old, outdated examples.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where old CAT headers would be injected while distributed tracing was enabled.

  This would happen if both `cross_application_tracing.enabled` and `distributed_tracing.enabled` were set to `true` and an instrumentation disabled tracing for an outbound request.
* Fixed access to `ConglomerateShim` in `shimmer`.
