### Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with transaction events not including correct duration values.

  This issue was introduced in v2.0.0, and it has affected web transactions histogram and percentile charts.
* Fixed issue with Redis instrumentation causing the agent to crash in some cases.

  Previously, the Redis instrumentation would crash the agent when Redis commands were called without a callback and after the transaction has ended.
* Fixed issue with the agent crashing on Node v4.0-4.4 and v5.0-5.9.

  This issue was caused by incorrect shim for Buffer.from(), and it affected older minor versions of Node v4 and v5.
