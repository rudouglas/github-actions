### New features

* The agent now reacts to failed New Relic requests based on response code, as opposed to parsing an exception message in the response body.

### Improvements

* Fixed clearing of active harvest via \_stopHarvester()
* Fixed handling of harvest endpoints when not all fail.
* Added agent state "connecting" to indicate when handshake with New Relic servers is starting. This can be triggered on startup and restarts.
* Added `--no-package-lock` to `unit` and `integration` rules.
* Released `protocol_17` feature flag.
* Replaced `nsp` with `npm audit` in security checks.
* Collector now specify `application/json` content-type when data is compressed instead of `octet-stream`.
* Bumped ecmaVersion in test .eslintrc to 8
