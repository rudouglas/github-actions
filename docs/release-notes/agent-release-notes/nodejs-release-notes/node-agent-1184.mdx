### Notes

* Fixed an inverted `if` in config loading.

  Previously, the config loader would log a warning on success, rather than failure. Configuration loading works as expected now.
* Fixed a bug in `process.nextTick` instrumentation for io.js 1.8.1.

  Previously the agent would only pass the callback argument to `process.nextTick`. This did not cause issues in Node.js and older version of io.js, since additional arguments were ignored. In a recent change to io.js, `process.nextTick` was changed to pass any additional arguments to the callback, the same way `setImmediate` does. This change ensures all arguments are handled as expected.
