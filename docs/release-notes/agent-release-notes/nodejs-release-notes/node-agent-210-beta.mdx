### Notes

You must read and agree to the [Beta Agreement](https://docs.google.com/a/newrelic.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBerTfWGWkpJRgCk343Zd8wvPXDspXpEnzvCIRR63XplhJAw/viewform) before using this beta version of the agent.

### New features

* Added `rowCallback` property to datastore segment descriptors.

  With this parameter the shim will record the given function/parameter as a per-row callback which may be called multiple times. These calls will be counted up for traces.

### Improvements

* Incorporated fixes from v1.30.0
* Rewrote PostgreSQL instrumentation using new `DatastoreShim` class.
* Reversed `reverse_naming_rules` default.

  Naming rules now default to evaluating in forward order.
