### Notes

* Triaged a defect in native promise instrumentation

  Transactions used to be lost acrossed chained `.then` calls. The way promises are wrapped has been changed to fix this issue.
* Added support for Slow Queries

  Slow Query information will now appear in the UI for Node agent users. This feature allows you to see a trace for slow datastore queries. Read more about this feature in our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-slow-query-details)
