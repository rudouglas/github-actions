### Fixes

* BREAKING: Updated the version of `https-proxy-agent` to v2.x - Dropped support for v0.10 and v0.12 of node.

  The version of `https-proxy-agent` used in the agent has a known security issue you can read about here: [https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:https-proxy-agent:20180402](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:https-proxy-agent:20180402) In order to resolve this issue, the dependency had to be updated to at least v2.2.0, which only supported node versions >=4. The update to this dependency forces the incompatibility of the agent with versions 0.10 and 0.12 of node.

  In order to use use the Node.js agent, please upgrade node to version >=4, or you can continue to use the agent on node versions 0.10 and 0.12 by pinning the agent to v3.
