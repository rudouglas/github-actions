### New features

* Express middleware metrics are now enabled by default.

### Improvements

* The following attributes are now sent to Insights along with transaction events: externalDuration, externalCallCount, and queueDuration.
* Custom SSL certificates (from the agent configuration) are now used even when a proxy is not explicitly defined. This is useful in some environments that use an implicit proxy for all network traffic.
