## New Features

* Added `@newrelic/aws-sdk` module to agent for auto-include on install.
* Added splitting of application name using semicolons in the env var.
* Instrumented `connection.execute` for `mysql2`.

## Improvements

* `@newrelic/native-metrics` module is defaulted to disabled in serverless mode.

  This can reduce lambda cold-start times by up to 170ms. The `native-metrics` module can rarely load in serverless environments due to differences from build environment to deployed environment and offers little value in a serverless environment.
* Added env var `NEW_RELIC_NATIVE_METRICS_ENABLED` to enable/disable the native-metrics module
* Added a test for querying poolCluster.of()
* Added HTTP method to segment attributes for external requests.
* Updated the `bin/ssl.sh` such that it uses verbose output, will exit on first error code, and will refuse to proceed with LibreSSL (which can't generate certs).
* Added a `clear` sub-command to `bin/ssl.sh` that will allow developers to quickly remove generated ssl/cert files and regenerate (useful is switch between platforms via containers/docker and certs needs to be regenerated)

## Fixes

* Removed unused `mysql` bootstrap test code.
* Increased timeout for `index-bad-version` test to reduce flickers on Node 12.
* Changed file modification to leverage `writeFile` for `watchFile` test. This triggers the watcher in a reasonable amount of time much more consistently.
* Removed testing of Bluebird 3.7 on Node v10 until they fix [the segfault issue](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues/1618).
