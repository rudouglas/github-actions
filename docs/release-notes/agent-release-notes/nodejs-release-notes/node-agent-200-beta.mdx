### Notes

You must read and agree to the [Beta Agreement](https://docs.google.com/a/newrelic.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBerTfWGWkpJRgCk343Zd8wvPXDspXpEnzvCIRR63XplhJAw/viewform) before using this beta version of the agent.

Dropped support for Node.js 0.6 and 0.8 as well as `node-mysql` package versions &lt; 1.0.0.

### New features

* Improved API for writing instrumentation.

  Introduced new classes for writing instrumentation, `Shim` and `DatastoreShim`. These classes along with the new `newrelic.instrument` and `newrelic.instrumentDatastore` methods make writing 3rd party instrumentation much easier.
* Rewrote instrumentation for Cassandra, Redis, ioredis, MySQL, and MongoDB.

  These instrumentations were rewritten using the new `DatastoreShim` interface. Their functionality is largely unchanged but the new code should be easier to maintain and extend.
* Added public API documentation.

  Documentation for the New Relic agent API has been generated using JSDoc and is now hosted on GitHub at [https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic). There you can find documentation on the new classes as well as the pre-existing API methods.
