### Notes

* Wrapped all our calls to `JSON.parse` in try/catch.

  Previously, only calls that were considered unsafe due to external data input were wrapped. We are taking a more defensive stance and wrapping them all now.
* Timers attached to `global` are now instrumented correctly in all version of io.js.

  As of v1.6.3 of io.js, timers are no longer lazily loaded from the timers module, and are placed directly on the global object. The agent now takes this change into account and accurately wraps the timer methods.
* Improved handling of cross-application tracing headers.

  Paths that include multibyte characters will now show up correctly in cross application maps
