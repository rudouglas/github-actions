### Bug fixes

* The `shutdown` method is now on the stub API.

  Previously when the agent was disabled the stub API passed back on require did not have the `shutdown` method. Thanks goes to Vlad Fedosov (@StyleT) for this contribution!
* Global timers will now be wrapped correctly regardless of being wrapped by something else.

  The logic to check whether to wrap the `global` timers was looking to see if the `global` timers were the same function reference as the ones in the `timers` module. This would break in cases where either the `global` or `timers` functions had been wrapped.
* Director instrumentation now correctly handles the case of null route handlers being passed in.

  Previously the agent's director instrumentation would crash in cases of null route handlers in director.
