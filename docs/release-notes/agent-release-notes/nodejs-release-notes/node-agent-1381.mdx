### Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with when.js instrumentation not preserving all properties on wrapped Promise constructor.

  Previously, the when.js instrumentation would cause an unhandled exception when private methods on the Promise constructor were called (e.g. when adapting functions that do not use promises).
