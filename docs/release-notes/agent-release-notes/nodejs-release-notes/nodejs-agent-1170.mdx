### Notes

* Added instrumentation for modules in Node core.
* Added support for native Promises in Node.js 0.12 and io.js 1.x.
* Traces will now contain separate segments for async waits and callbacks.
* Updated instrumentation for MongoDB to support previously un-instrumented methods for 1.x and 2.x versions of the node-mongodb-native driver.
* Fixed a bug in the recording of transaction metrics. Previously this would cause a duplicate of the transaction metric to be displayed in the transaction breakdown chart
* Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products.

  The response time charts in the application overview page will now include NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB,and also the product name of existing SQL databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, etc. For existing SQL databases, in addition to the existing breakdown of SQL statements and operations, the queries are now also associated with the database product being used. For NoSQL datastores, such as Cassandra and MongoDB, we have now added information about operations performed against those products, similar to what is being done for SQL databases.

  This new unified Databases page will enable the filtering of metrics and operations by product, and includes a table listing all operations.

  Because this introduces a notable change to how SQL database metrics are collected, it is important that you upgrade the agent version on all hosts. If you are unable to transition to the latest agent version on all hosts at the same time, you can still access old and new metric data for SQL databases, but the information will be split across two separate views.
