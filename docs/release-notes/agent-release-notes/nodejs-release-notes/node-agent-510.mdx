### New features

* Added new shim type: `ConglomerateShim`

  This shim class is useful for instrumenting modules which implement several service interfaces of different types.

### Improvements

* Disabled logging by default when serverless_mode is enabled. Please note serverless/lambda monitoring is not yet officially released.
* `null` trace attribute values are no longer sent to New Relic.

  This change brings the Node agent in alignment with the behavior of other language agents.
