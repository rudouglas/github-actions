### New features

* Added `DatastoreShim#getDatabaseNameFromUseQuery`

  This new method can be used to extract the database name from `USE` SQL queries.

### Improvements

* Added link to CONTRIBUTING.md file in README.md

  Thanks to Yuri Tkachenko (@tamtamchik) for the contribution.
* Added VS Code settings to git ignore.
* Fixed bug preventing Distributed Tracing (DT) from fully functioning when Cross Application Tracing (CAT) was disabled.
* Renames better-cat integration test organization to be distributed-tracing and updated some test verbiage to use DT or distributed tracing instead of CAT or cross application tracing.

### Bug fixes

* The agent will no longer break express routers in the case of using regex paths in a list.

  Previously, the agent would overwrite the regex with the source of the regex. The agent now makes a copy of the route array and mutates that instead.
* Attributes will now be properly propagated to PageView events.

  The agent may now be configured to pass attributes along to the browser agent. The attributes that match the include/exclude rules in the `browser_monitor.attributes` section will now be placed on PageView events.
