### New Features

* Added CPU metric gathering to Node.js versions &lt;6.1

  As of this release the agent will attempt to gather CPU usage metrics via the optional `@newrelic/native-metrics` module.
* Added additional memory usage classification metrics.

  The agent will now report memory metrics that break down memory by its current use.

  For more information on these features, see [our documentation.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/node-vm-measurements)
