### Bug fixes

* Fixed a transaction state loss introduced in Node 7.10.0 when using `net.createConnection`.

  Added a new segment for `net.connect`, `net.createConnection`, and `http.Agent#createConnection`. Sockets created within a transaction also have their `emit` bound to the segment.
* Fixed a typo about the name of the default configuration file. Thanks Jacob LeGrone (@jlegrone)!
