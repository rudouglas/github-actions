### Bug fixes

* When.js hooks similar to `Promise.onPotentiallyUnhandledRejection` now function as intended.

  Previously, hooks like `Promise.onPotentiallyUnhandledRejection` would not work due to the way the agent wraps the promise constructor. When.js expects these handles to be assigned directly onto the promise constructor, and our wrapper was intercepting the assignment. The wrapper will now properly proxy these values and assign them onto the original constructor, restoring the proper behavior.
* Express route parameters will now be properly attached to the corresponding transaction.

  Previously, our express instrumentation would read the route parameters and place them on the segment responsible for matching the parameters. This behavior did not place the parameters on the transaction that the segments belonged to, causing the parameters to not show up properly on transaction traces and transaction events.
