### New Features

* Modifies `MiddlewareSpec` route property to allow functions. Defers route processing and segment naming until just before needed (each middleware invocation).

### Improvements

* Fixed outdated `license` ref in `package.json`.
* Middleware instrumentation now honors `spec.appendPath` for more cases and will not pop paths when it has not appended a path.
