### New features

* Advanced Analytics for APM Errors

  With this release, the agent reports [TransactionError events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/error-event-default-attributes-insights). These new events power the [Advanced Analytics for APM Errors](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/view-apm-errors-error-traces) feature. The error events are also available through [New Relic Insights](http://newrelic.com/insights).

  Advanced Analytics for APM Errors lets you see all of your errors with granular detail, filter and group by any attribute to analyze them, and take action to resolve issues through collaboration.

### Bug fixes

* `NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED` environment variable is now treated as a boolean.

  Previously, this option was treated as a string, causing it to not work for some use cases. Thanks to @jakecraige for contributing this fix!
