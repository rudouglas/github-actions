### Notes

* **This release has been unpublished from npmjs.org**. Use [v1.21.1](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes/node-agent-1211) or higher instead.
* Support for [display host names](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/add-rename-remove-hosts#display_name).

  The agent now has configuration settings to allow configuration of custom host names. Set [`process_host.display_name`](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#custom-hostnames-display) to enable this.

  If this config is not set, the agent will continue to use the host name found through an `os.hostname()` call. Should this lookup fail somehow, [`process_host.ipv_preference`](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#custom-hostnames-ipv) can now be set to `4` or `6` to configure the type of ip address displayed in place of the host name.
