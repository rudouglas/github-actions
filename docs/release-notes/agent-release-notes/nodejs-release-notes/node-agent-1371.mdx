<Callout variant="important">

</Callout>

### Improvements

* Agent now wraps `emit` on http request/response objects instead of relying on listeners.
* Improved documentation for `newrelic.noticeError()` and `ignore_status_codes` configuration.

  The documentation now makes it clear that errors recorded using `noticeError()` do not obey the `ignore_status_codes` configuration value.
* Removed unused `yakaa` dependency.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in normalization rules when replacements do not maintain initial `/`.
* Better de-duplication of errors when the same error instance is used multiple times.
* Server-side naming rules are now applied even when user defined ones have matched.
* Errors reported outside of a transaction now include their stack trace on the error analytics page.
* A potential stack overflow in trace serialization has been removed.
* Fixed an issue with our Express and domain instrumentation related to a loss of transaction state that could result in incorrect transaction names, traces, and events.
* Nested background transactions now report the correct number of metrics.
