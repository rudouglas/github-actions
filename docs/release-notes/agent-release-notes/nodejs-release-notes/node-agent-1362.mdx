### Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with timing Redis operations when called without a callback.

  Previously these operations would continue to be timed until the transaction ended, and as a result reported incorrect times.
* Transactions that result in a 404 HTTP error are now named "(not found)".

  Previously these transactions were reported with no name (e.g. get /).
* When the newrelic.js configuration file is not present, the agent now logs a message to the console and no longer prevents the app from starting up.
