### New Features

* Added support for recording interfaces that return promises instead of taking callbacks. See `RecorderSpec.promise` for more details.

  Thanks to Gert Sallaerts (@Gertt) for this contribution.

### Improvements

* Incorporated fixes and features from 1.36.2, 1.37.0, and 1.37.1.
* Domains are no longer preemptively instrumented, thus applications that do not use domains will not load the domain module.

  Including the domain module causes a small amount of extra overhead in other core libraries that must keep the domain state set correctly.
