### Fixes

* Added instrumentation of Bluebird promises.

  Previously, the transaction state could get lost when multiple promises resolved close to each other.
* Fixed issue with PostgreSQL native instrumentation.

  Previously, calling `require('pg').native` more than once was causing the agent to crash.
* Fixed issue with hapi instrumentation not returning value from Server.connection().
* Various improvements to tests to make them more stable.
