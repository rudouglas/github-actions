### Fixes

* Fixed metric merging when using debug.internal_metrics.

  The debug metrics cache would cause timestamps for harvested metrics to get stuck at agent startup. This will no longer happen, and the debug cache is reset each harvest.

### Improvements

* Modularized configuration constants to improve readability.
