### Improvements

* The following attributes are now sent to Insights along with transaction events: databaseDuration, databaseCallCount.
* Updated Redis instrumentation to work with version 2.x of the redis module.
* Improvements to error tracking on systems that have a lot of errors.
* Minor improvements in tests and logging.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a few issues with the Express instrumentation.

  Middleware functions mounted with a path variable now generate the correct middleware metrics. Routers mounted using route methods now generate the correct trace segments and times. Routers mounted on root path are now not included in trace when they contain no matching routes.
