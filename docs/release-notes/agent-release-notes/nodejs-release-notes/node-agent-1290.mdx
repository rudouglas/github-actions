### Improvements

* Domain error handlers will now be scoped to the transaction the error occurred in.

  Previously, the `'error'` event handlers would not be scoped to a transaction causing our API methods to not associate data correctly (e.g. using `noticeError` would not associate the error with the transaction and would instead be unscoped).

### Bug fixes

* Reworked the SQL parser to handle new lines in the query.

  Previously the agent would have difficulty classifying queries with new lines in them. Thanks to Libin Lu (@evollu) for the fix!
* Postgres instrumentation is now compatible with inputs with text getter attributes.

  Thanks again to Libin Lu (@evollu) for the fix!
