### Bug fixes

* Removed automatic installation of `@newrelic/native-metrics`.

  Due to the way npm v3+ flatten dependencies, a bug in the version of npm packaged with Node v5, and npm v1's ungraceful handling of scoped packages we have opted to not automatically install this module.

  If you would like to see native metrics for your application, you can add the `@newrelic/native-metrics` module to your `package.json` and the Node Agent will automatically pick it up.
* Corrected attribution of the Bluebird patch in the last release's notes.

  Thanks to Matt Lavin (@mdlavin) for this correction!
