## 3.3.0

### New Features

* Added support for GraphQL in two new integrations:

  * [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) with [v3/integrations/nrgraphgophers](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrgraphgophers).
    * [Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrgraphgophers)
    * [Example](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/v3/integrations/nrgraphgophers/example/main.go)
  * [graphql-go/graphql](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql) with [v3/integrations/nrgraphqlgo](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrgraphqlgo).
    * [Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrgraphqlgo)
    * [Example](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/v3/integrations/nrgraphqlgo/example/main.go)
* Added database instrumentation support for [snowflakedb/gosnowflake](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake).

  * [Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrsnowflake)
  * [Example](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/v3/integrations/nrsnowflake/example/main.go)

### Changes

* When using [`newrelic.StartExternalSegment`](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic#StartExternalSegment) or [`newrelic.NewRoundTripper`](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic#NewRoundTripper), if existing cross application tracing or distributed tracing headers are present on the request, they will be replaced instead of added.
* The [`FromContext`](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic#FromContext) API which allows you to pull a Transaction from a context.Context will no longer panic if the provided context is nil. In this case, a nil is returned.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

If a .NET agent is initiating distributed traces as the root service, you must update that .NET agent to version 8.24 or later before upgrading your downstream Go New Relic agents to this agent release.
