### New

* Added new RecordCustomMetric method to [Application](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent#Application). This functionality can be used to track averages or counters without using custom events. See [Custom Metric Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics)
* Fixed import needed for `logrus`. The import `Sirupsen/logrus` had been renamed to `sirupsen/logrus`. Thanks to @alfred-landrum for spotting this.
* Added [ErrorAttributer](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent#ErrorAttributer), an optional interface that can be implemented by errors provided to `Transaction.NoticeError` to attach additional attributes. These attributes are subject to attribute configuration.
* Added [Error](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent#Error), a type that allows direct control of error fields.
* Updated license to address scope of usage.
