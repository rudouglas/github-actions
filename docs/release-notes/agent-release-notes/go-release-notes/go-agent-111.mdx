### New Features

* Added support for Cross Application Tracing (CAT). Please refer to [the upgrading section of the guide](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/v1.11.0/GUIDE.md#upgrading-applications-to-support-cross-application-tracing) for more detail on how to ensure you get the most out of the Go agent's new CAT support.
* The agent now collects additional metadata when running within Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry. This information is used to provide an enhanced experience when the agent is deployed on those platforms.
