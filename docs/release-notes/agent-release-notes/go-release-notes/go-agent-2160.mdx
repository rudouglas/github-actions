## 2.16.0

### Upcoming

* The next release of the Go Agent is expected to be a major version release to improve the API and incorporate Go modules. Details available here: [https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/106](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/106) We would love your feedback!

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue in the [nrhttprouter](http://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/_integrations/nrhttprouter) integration where the transaction was not being added to the requests context. This resulted in an inability to access the transaction from within an [httprouter.Handle](https://godoc.org/github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter#Handle) function. This issue has now been fixed.
