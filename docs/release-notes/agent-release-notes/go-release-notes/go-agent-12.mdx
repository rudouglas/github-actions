### Notes

* Added support for instrumenting short-lived processes:

  * The new `Application.Shutdown` method allows applications to report data to New Relic without waiting a full minute.
  * The new `Application.WaitForConnection` method allows your process to defer instrumentation until the application is connected and ready to gather data.
  * Full documentation here: [application.go](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/application.go)
  * Example short-lived process: [examples/short-lived-process/main.go](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/examples/short-lived-process/main.go)
* Error metrics are no longer created when `ErrorCollector.Enabled = false`.
* Added support for [http://wwwgithub.com/mgutz/logxi](http://www.github.com/mgutz/logxi). See [https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/\_integrations/nrlogxi/v1/nrlogxi.go](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/_integrations/nrlogxi/v1/nrlogxi.go).
* Fixed bug where Transaction Trace thresholds based upon Apdex were not being applied to background transactions.
