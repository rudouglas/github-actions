## 2.16.1

### New Relic's Go agent v3.0 is currently available for review and beta testing. Your use of this pre-release is at your own risk. New Relic disclaims all warranties, express or implied, regarding the beta release.

### If you do not manually take steps to use the new v3 folder, as described below, you will not see any changes in your agent.

This 2.16.1 release includes a new v3.0 folder which contains the pre-release of Go agent v3.0; Go agent v3.0 includes breaking changes. We are seeking feedback and hope that you will look this over and test out the changes prior to the official release.

**This is not an official 3.0 release, it is just a vehicle to gather feedback on proposed changes**. It is not tagged as 3.0 in Github and the 3.0 release is not yet available to update in your Go mod file. In order to test out these changes, you will need to clone this repo in your Go source directory, under `[go-src-dir]/src/github.com/newrelic/go-agent`. Once you have the source checked out, you will need to follow the steps in the second section of [v3/MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/v3/MIGRATION.md).

A list of changes and installation instructions is included in the v3 folder and can be found [here](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/v3/MIGRATION.md)

For this pre-release (beta) version of Go agent v3.0, please note:

* The changes in the v3 folder represent what we expect to release in {'~'}2 weeks as our major 3.0 release. However, as we are soliciting feedback on the changes and there is the possibility of some breaking changes before the official release.
* This is not an official 3.0 release; it is not tagged as 3.0 in Github and the 3.0 release is not yet available to update in your Go mod file.
* If you test out these changes and encounter issues, questions, or have feedback that you would like to pass along, please open up an issue [here](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/new) and be sure to include the label `3.0`.
  * For normal (non-3.0) issues/questions we request that you report them via our [support site](http://support.newrelic.com/) or our [community forum](https://discuss.newrelic.com). Please only report questions related to the 3.0 pre-release directly via GitHub.

### New Features

* V3 will add support for Go Modules. The go.mod files exist in the v3 folder, but they will not be usable until we have fully tagged the 3.0 release officially. Examples of version tags we plan to use for different modules include:
  * `v3.0.0`
  * `v3/integrations/nrecho-v3/v1.0.0`
  * `v3/integrations/nrecho-v4/v1.0.0`

### Changes

* The changes are the ones that we have requested feedback previously in [this issue](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/issues/106).
* A full list of changes that are included, along with a checklist for upgrading, is available in [v3/MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/v3/MIGRATION.md).
