### Notes

* Fixed incorrect metric rule application when the metric rule is flagged to terminate and matches but the name is unchanged.
* `Segment.End()`, `DatastoreSegment.End()`, and `ExternalSegment.End()` methods now return an error which may be helpful in diagnosing situations where segment data is unexpectedly missing.
