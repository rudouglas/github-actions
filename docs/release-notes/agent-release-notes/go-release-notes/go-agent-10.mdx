### Notes

* Removed `BetaToken` from the `Config` structure.
* Breaking Datastore change: `datastore` package contents moved to top level `newrelic` package. `datastore.MySQL` has become `newrelic.DatastoreMySQL`.
* Breaking Attributes change: `attributes` package contents moved to top level `newrelic` package. `attributes.ResponseCode` has become `newrelic.AttributeResponseCode`. Some attribute name constants have been shortened.
* Added "runtime.NumCPU" to the environment tab. Thanks sergeylanzman for the contribution.
* Prefixed the environment tab values "Compiler", "GOARCH", "GOOS", and "Version" with "runtime."
