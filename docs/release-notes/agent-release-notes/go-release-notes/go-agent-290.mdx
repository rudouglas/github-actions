## 2.9.0

### New Features

* Added support for [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) monitoring with the new [\_integrations/nrgrpc](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/_integrations/nrgrpc) package. This package supports instrumentation for servers and clients.

  * [Server Example](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/_integrations/nrgrpc/example/server/server.go)
  * [Client Example](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/_integrations/nrgrpc/example/client/client.go)
* Added new [ExternalSegment](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent#ExternalSegment) fields `Host`, `Procedure`, and `Library`. These optional fields are automatically populated from the segment's `URL` or `Request` if unset. Use them if you don't have access to a request or URL but still want useful external metrics, transaction segment attributes, and span attributes.

  * `Host` is used for external metrics, transaction trace segment names, and span event names. The host of segment's `Request` or `URL` is the default.
  * `Procedure` is used for transaction breakdown metrics. If set, it should be set to the remote procedure being called. The HTTP method of the segment's `Request` is the default.
  * `Library` is used for external metrics and the `"component"` span attribute. If set, it should be set to the framework making the call. `"http"` is the default.

  With the addition of these new fields, external transaction breakdown metrics are changed: `External/myhost.com/all` will now report as `External/myhost.com/http/GET` (provided the HTTP method is `GET`).
* HTTP Response codes below `100`, except `0` and `5`, are now recorded as errors. This is to support `gRPC` status codes. If you start seeing new status code errors that you would like to ignore, add them to `Config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes` or your server side configuration settings.
* Improve [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) support by introducing [nrlogrus.Transform](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/_integrations/nrlogrus#Transform), a function which allows you to turn a [logrus.Logger](https://godoc.org/github.com/sirupsen/logrus#Logger) instance into a [newrelic.Logger](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent#Logger). Example use:

  ```
  l := logrus.New()
  l.SetLevel(logrus.DebugLevel)
  cfg := newrelic.NewConfig("Your Application Name", "__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__")
  cfg.Logger = nrlogrus.Transform(l)
  ```

  As a result of this change, the [nrlogrus](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/_integrations/nrlogrus) package requires [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) version `v1.1.0` and above.
