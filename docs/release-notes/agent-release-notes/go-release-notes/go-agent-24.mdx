### 2.4.0 Notes

* Introduced `Transaction.Application` method which returns the `Application` that started the `Transaction`. This method is useful since it may prevent having to pass the `Application` to code that already has access to the `Transaction`. Example use:

```
txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent("customerOrder", map[string]interface{}{
    "numItems":   2,
    "totalPrice": 13.75,
})
```

* The `Transaction.AddAttribute` method no longer accepts `nil` values since our backend ignores them.
