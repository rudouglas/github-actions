### Fixes

* Fixed issue where "Query plan threshold" from server settings was being incorrectly interpreted. This caused a spike in SQL traces as well as explain plan executions for clients using server configuration.
* Fixed a potential memory leak when an update to agent configuration is performed.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
