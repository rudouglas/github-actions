### New Features

* [Async mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net): Added support for the `metricName` and `transactionNamingPriority` custom instrumentation options when async mode is enabled.
* Async mode: Added support for Castle MonoRail 2.x when async mode is enabled. Note that MonoRail transactions previously named `WebTransaction/DotNetController/{controller}/{action}` will be renamed to `WebTransaction/MonoRail/{controller}/{action}` when async mode is enabled.
* Async mode: Added support for legacy ScriptHandlerFactory instrumentation when async mode is enabled.
* Removes instrumentation for deprecated methods in Umbraco. The default instrumentation for ASP .NET MVC or ASP .NET Web API will now be used by the agent in its place.

### Fixes

* Async mode: Fixed an issue where the agent would not clean up SQL connections after explain plan execution when async mode is enabled.
* Async mode: Fixed a bug which would cause a SerializationException to occur when async mode is enabled which could result in an app crash.
