* **\[.NET Framework]** Added the ability to enable the agent from the local `newrelic.config` file for all non-IIS hosted .NET Framework applications. Additional information can be found at: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/additional-installation/...](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/additional-installation/instrument-non-iis-apps#newrelic-config-local)

### Fixes

* The profiler now honors the log level configuration setting that is set in the app-local `newrelic.config` file.
