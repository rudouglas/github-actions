subject: .NET agent
releaseDate: '2016-04-13'
version: 5.18.36.0

### New Features

* [Async mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net): Instrumentation of NServiceBus is now enabled when the AsyncMode flag is true.
* Async mode: Added support for Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ) instrumentation when Async mode is enabled.
* Async mode: Microsoft Enterprise Library officially supported when Async mode is enabled.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug where ASP.NET 4.5+ applications would not get transactions for requests that had invalid query stings (such as "myPage.aspx?test=").
* Fixed an issue where metrics from database calls using Enterprise Library would display as from vendor "Other." The metrics should now show the appropriate supported vendor (Oracle, MsSql, etc.).
* Fixed a bug that prevented SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery commands from being instrumented with the default instrumentation xml files.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
