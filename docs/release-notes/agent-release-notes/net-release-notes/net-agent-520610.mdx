### New Features

* [Async mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net): Added `System.Web.Script.Services.WebServiceMethodData` support to .NET Async mode. All transactions named from this instrumentation will now use the more appropriate naming format of: `WebService/{ServiceClassName}/{MethodName}`.
* [Async mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net): Added OpenRasta support to .NET Async mode. This instrumentation now appropriately names transactions using the `{Controller}/{Action}` format.
* Moved `System.Web.UI.Page.PerformPreInit`, `System.Web.Compilation.AssemblyBuilder.Compile` and `System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.CompileWebFile` instrumentation configuration elements from the CoreInstrumentation.xml file to the Asp35.Instrumentation.xml file.

### Fixes

* [Async mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net): Resolved an issue where the agent incorrectly handled HttpClient async requests that timed-out or were manually cancelled. These would show up as wrapper errors.

### Upgrading
