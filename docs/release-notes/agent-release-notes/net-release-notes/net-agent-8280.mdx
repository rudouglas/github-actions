### New Features

### Fixes

* **Infinite Tracing**
  * Fixes issue with Infinite Tracing where a communication error can result in consuming too much CPU.
  * Fixes issue with Infinite Tracing where a communication error did not clean up its corresponding communication threads.
  * Agent version 8.30 introduces significant performance enhancements to Infinite Tracing. To use Infinite Tracing, please upgrade to version 8.30 or later.
* Fixes issue in .NET Framework ASP.NET MVC applications where transactions started on one thread would flow to background threads (e.g., started with `Task.Run`) in some scenarios but not others. Transaction state used to only flow to a background thread if the transaction originated from an async controller action. Transaction state now flows to background threads regardless of whether the controller action is async or not.
* Fixes issue in .NET Framework ASP.NET MVC applications where agent instrumentation of an MVC controller action could cause an `InvalidProgramException`.
* Fixes a problem with the reporting of Errors where Error Events may not appear even though Error Traces are being sent.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
