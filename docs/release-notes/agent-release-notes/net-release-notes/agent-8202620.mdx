### New Features

* Improved support for WCF.

  * Support for Task-based (TAP) service calls.
  * Distributed Tracing and CAT are automatically supported for HTTP-based binding types (such as BasicHTTP, WebHTTP, WSHTTP).
  * Non-HTTP binding types (such as NetTCP, MSMQ, Named Pipes) are instrumented, but do not automatically support Distributed Tracing and CAT.
* **\[.NET Core]** Adds support for .NET Core 3.1 beginning with preview 1.
* Performance Metrics: The .Net Agent collects information about application performance in the following areas.

  * Memory and CPU Utilization
  * Garbage Collection
  * Threadpool Usage and Throughput

  Please refer to [online documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/other-features/net-performance-metrics) for further information.

### Fixes

* **\[.NET Framework]** Fix an issue where reading application settings from `web.config` or `app.config` could prevent the agent from starting up.
* **\[.NET Framework]** Fix an issue where the agent caused an application to deadlock when using a [ConfigurationBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/config-builder). This was commonly seen in applications using the [AzureKeyVaultConfigBuilder](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Configuration.ConfigurationBuilders.Azure/).
* Fix an issue introduced in 8.16 where Memory and CPU metrics failed to update.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
