### Fixes

* Fixes an issue where errors set to be ignored through configuration were not being ignored.

### Notes

* We will be removing the `core_20` directory from the download site the week of September 3rd, 2018 as it contains a deprecated version of the .Net Core agent. Please be sure to update any of your scripts that reference this location accordingly.
  * All downloads for the current version of the agent can be found in the `latest_release` directory on the download site.
  * Historical versions can be found in the `previous_releases` directory.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
