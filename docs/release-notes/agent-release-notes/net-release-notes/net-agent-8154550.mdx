### Fixes

* Fixes a problem with parsing method signatures that do not align with ECMA-335 that could cause an application to crash.
* Fixes a problem where third-party libraries that perform assembly-scanning using reflection may encounter TypeLoadExceptions.
* Fixes a problem where the agent may incorrectly report Response Time when custom instrumentation is applied to methods that are called from within an instrumented framework (such as ASP.Net).
* Resolves security issue with how SQL Server handles escaping which could lead to a failure to correctly obfuscate SQL statements. See [Security Bulletin NR19-03](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr19-03).
* Resolves issue with not rolling up 30x HTTP response codes which resulted in MGI issues.

### New Features

* Adds improved WCF support
  * WCF client task asynchronous programming model (following the task asynchronous pattern) calls are tracked as external calls.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
