### Fixes

* Fixes a bug where the .NET Agent was not handling exceptions coming from HttpRequest.Path and HttpRequest.Url properties. Because the exception was unhandled users would see a System.Web.HttprequestValidationException in their log files and in some cases could miss transactions being reported.
* Fixes a bug where the .NET Agent was throwing null reference exceptions when tracing some SQL commands where there was no transaction available.
* Fixes a bug where the .NET Agent was reporting StackExchange.Redis call times incorrectly. Now, the agent reports the correct call times for apps that use StackExchange.Redis synchronously.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
