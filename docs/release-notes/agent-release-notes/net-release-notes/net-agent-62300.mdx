### Notes

_This is a security-only release for the 6.x agents that support legacy frameworks (.NET version 4.5 and lower). If you are on .NET version 4.5 and higher or .NET Core, the 7.x or later versions of the agent should be used._

### Fixes

* Resolved security issue with how SQL Server handles escaping which could lead to a failure to correctly obfuscate SQL statements. See [Security Bulletin NR19-03](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr19-03).

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
