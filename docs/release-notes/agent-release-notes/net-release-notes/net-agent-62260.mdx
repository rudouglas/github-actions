### New Features

* Added support for IBM DB2 including slow query support. You'll see relevant breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces.

### Fixes

* The enabled attribute of the transactionTracer, when set to false, should disable all transaction trace output. This has been fixed in the .NET agent version 6.2.26.0

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
