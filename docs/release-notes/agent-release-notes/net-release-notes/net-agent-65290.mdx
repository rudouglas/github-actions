### New Features

* The agent now collects datastore instance information for Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostGreSQL, Oracle, DB2, and Redis. This information is displayed in transaction traces and slow query traces. Datastore instance details are captured by default. For more information, visit [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-da...](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues)
* SQL trace identifiers now use an 8-byte value instead of a 4-byte value so that Data Loss Prevention monitors do not interpret the value as a 9-digit Social Security Number.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
