version: 5.5.52.0

### New Features

* Added StackExchange.Redis framework support. The .Net agent now records time spent making StackExchange.Redis API calls, which will appear as Datastore metrics and Transaction Trace segments in New Relic APM.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that cause Automatic Browser Monitoring to cause problems on web pages that have no HEAD tag and also contain the text "&lt;BODY" inside of an inline script.
* Improved agent error reporting for applications using WebAPI v1 in unsupported configurations. A warning will be displayed in the agent log (during agent startup) if an application is using an unsupported configuration.
* Azure KUDU (scm) sites were being instrumented by the .NET Agent due to a change in the way Azure is naming application pools. We have updated our logic to match the new application pool naming so these sites will be ignored by the agent.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
