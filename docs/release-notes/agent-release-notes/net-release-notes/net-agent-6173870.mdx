### Fixes

* The injection of Browser Monitor JavaScript directly above the body tag on a page should occur less often.
* Fixes issue where datastore instance information would not be reported for some NpgsqlCommand async calls.
* Fixed remaining cases where 9-digit SQL trace identifiers were generated, failing Data Loss Prevention monitors which interpret the value as a Social Security Number.
