### New Features

* This release adds Transaction event attributes that provide context between your Kubernetes cluster and services. For details on the benefits see [this blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/monitoring-application-performance-in-kubernetes/).
* The [NewRelic.Agent NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NewRelic.Agent/) now includes the x86 (32-bit) profiler for Windows. To monitor 32-bit Windows applications using this NuGet package the `COR_PROFILER_PATH` ([.NET Framework](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-framework-agent#nuget)) or the `CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH` ([.NET Core](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-core-agent#nuget)) environment variable needs to be set to the path the of the 32-bit profiler DLL (NewRelic.Profiler.x86.dll).
* For .NET Core applications hosted in Azure App Services, the [New Relic Azure Site Extension](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.Extension/) can now be used to install the agent. This was previously only available for .NET Framework applications. Follow these [procedures](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-net-agent-azure-web-apps#site-extention-install) to install.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the NRQL [Extrapolate clause](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#extrapolate) in Insights did not work properly for Transaction Events.
* Fixed an issue where cross application tracing could cause a metric grouping issue (MGI) for web requests that result in a 300 or higher response status code. Transaction names may now be rolled up by status code.
* Fixed an issue where browser script injection in ASP.NET applications could cause a metric grouping issue (MGI) for web requests that result in a 30x redirect status code. Transaction names may now be rolled up by status code.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
