### Fixes

* Security Bulletin [NR18-07](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-07): The agent will no longer run explain plans on MySQL queries which have multiple statements.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
