### Fixes

* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) “pre-flight” requests with the HTTP OPTIONS method were causing extraneous metrics to be generated for ASP.NET Core applications using the CORS middleware. These requests will now be ignored by the agent.
* Fixes a problem where WCF instrumentation shuts down when WebHttpBinding is used and CAT is enabled.
* Fixes a problem where an async WCF client call may prevent further data from being captured in a transaction.

### New Features

* Adds database instrumentation for Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
