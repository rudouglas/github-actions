### New Features

* Async mode: The .NET agent now has an optional async mode which provides a look at the agent's asynchronous framework instrumentation as it becomes available. As of this release, asynchronous instrumentation for System.Net.Http.HttpClient and System.Net.HttpWebRequest are available when the agent is in async mode. Please note that activating async mode disables some functionality within the .NET agent. More details and instructions are available here: [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net)

### Improvements

* Added new log for cases where the .NET Agent cannot inject Browser Agent

### Fixes

* Fixes an issue where intermittent connection issues would cause the Agent to shut down until the process was restarted.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
