### New Features

* [Async mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net): Custom instrumentation is now supported for both synchronous and asynchronous methods when async mode is enabled, however; the metricName and transactionNamePriority elements will not be respected. This is coming in a future release. Please see our [custom instrumentation documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/instrumentation/net-custom-instrumentation) for details.

### Fixes

* Changes the log messages for when a wrapper / method combination needs to be shut down. The new message provides more information and clarity around the shutdown event.
