### New Features

* **Thread profiling support for Linux**

  Thread profiling on Linux will be supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Triggering a thread profile is done from the `Thread profiler` page in APM.
* **Accessing Span-Specific information using the .NET Agent API**

  New property, `CurrentSpan` has been added to `IAgent` and `ITransaction`. It returns an object implementing `ISpan` which provides access to span-specific functions within the API.
* **Adding Custom Span Attributes using the .NET Agent API**

  New method, `AddCustomAttribute(string, object)` has been added to `ISpan`.

  * This new method accepts and supports all data-types.
  * Further information may be found within [.NET Agent API documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/iSpan).
  * Adding custom attributes to spans requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. See [.NET agent configuration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#distributed_tracing)

### Fixes

* Fixes issue where adding multiple custom attributes on a Transaction using [`ITransaction.AddCustomAttribute`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/itransaction#addcustomattribute) causes the agent to ignore additional attempts to add custom attributes to any transaction.
* Fixes issue that prevented Custom Events from being sent to New Relic until the agent shuts down.
* Fixes issue that can cause asynchronous Redis calls in an ASP.NET MVC application to report an inflated duration.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
