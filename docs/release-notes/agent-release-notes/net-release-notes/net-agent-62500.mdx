subject: .NET agent
releaseDate: '2020-01-15'
version: 6.25.0.0
---

**This is a security-only release for the 6.x agents that support legacy frameworks (.NET version 4.5 and lower). If you are on .NET version 4.5 or higher, or if you are on .NET Core, use the 8.x or later agent versions.**

### Fixes

* Fixes security vulnerability [NR20-01](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr20-01) which may cause SQL parameter values to appear in the agent log file when the logging level is set to Debug or Finest and the calling application supplies SQL parameters without a `@` prefix.
* Fixes an issue where Explain Plans are not generated for database commands with parameters that do not have the `@` prefix on the name.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
