### New Features

* Added ability to configure the use of Gzip compression instead of Deflate (the default) when sending data to New Relic. This can be useful in cases where DLP software requires Gzip compression for verification.
* Added ability to configure the use of PUT instead of POST (the default) for sending data to New Relic. This can be useful in cases where DLP software requires PUT for verification.

### Fixes

* Fixed issue where the [Database Queries tab](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details#drilldown) would not appear for relevant transaction traces in APM.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
