### New Features

* The request URI for a web transaction will now be included as an attribute of transaction events and error events.
* The New Relic .NET Status Monitor has been retired and is no longer included in the install. The replacement tool is [New Relic Diagnostics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics). To download the most recent version, select the link in the [New Relic Diagnostics documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics#run-diagnostics).

### Fixes

* Security Bulletin [NR17-06](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr17-06): Fixes issue where query parameters were being included in the URL property of transaction trace segments for external calls (uses of System.Net.HttpClient, System.Net.WebRequest, or third-party libraries which are built on top of those). Query parameters will no longer be included in transaction trace segments.
* Transaction names will be rolled up for web transactions resulting in a 400 or 500 level HTTP status code and a higher priority name has not been set. This helps prevent [metric grouping issues](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues).
* Fixed error that could result in the one time loss of a metric and/or transaction for an instrumentation point at the start of monitoring an application. "...NewRelic ERROR: Tracer invocation error: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: ..."
* Minor log level adjustments in the profiler logging. Suppresses benign error `Failed to tokenize method signature: class System.Reflection.Assembly System.CannotUnloadAppDomainException::LoadAssemblyOrThrow(string)`
* **\[.NET Core 2.0]** For .NET Core agent users on Linux, this release fixes a problem with the `run.sh` convenience script in combination with a custom installation path.
* **\[.NET Framework]** Fixes issue resulting in SerializationExceptions when using .Net Remoting.

### Upgrading
