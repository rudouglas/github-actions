### Fixes

Added auto instrumentation to prevent associating Serilog PeriodicBatchingSink activity with an applicationâ€™s transactions.

Added [API support](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis) for manually creating and accepting distributed tracing payloads.

### Upgrading
