### New Features

* Custom instrumentation can now be declared by applying the agent API's new Transaction and Trace attributes to methods. Using the Transaction attribute, transactions can be marked as Web vs. Non-Web. For more information, see [Custom instrumentation via attributes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/custom-instrumentation-attributes-net).

### Fixes

* Fixes bug preventing instrumented apps from shutting down due to Profiler failure to detach.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).
