### New Features

New Features

* Added support for Stack Exchange Redis strongly named assembly: StackExchange.Redis.StrongName.
* Added support for the "CustomSegmentTracerFactory" custom instrumentation option. See [docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/instrumentation/net-custom-instrumentation) for example usage.
* [Async mode](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net): Added support for NpgsqlCommand asynchronous methods (such as ExecuteReaderAsync) when the agent is in Async mode.
* Async mode: Explain plans for MS SQL and MySQL commands are now available when the agent is in Async mode.

### Fixes

* Async mode: Fixed a bug that prevented SQL activity from being recorded in transactions.
* Fixed a bug where the incorrect namespace of the default asynchronous wrapper was used. The incorrect name was "NewRelic.Agent.Core.Wrapper.DefaultWrapperAsync" and is now "NewRelic.Providers.Wrapper.CustomInstrumentationAsync.DefaultWrapperAsync". Any customers that had created a custom instrumentation file and put the incorrect name in it as a workaround should change it to the correct name.
* Duplicate custom parameters will now be logged as Debug level, providing a minor performance improvement.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.
