### Improvements

* Register an [MBean](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/28) to expose the agent linking metadata.
* Support for [okhttp 4.4](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/16) instrumentation.
* [Improve reconnect behavior](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/14) by _not_ pinning to preconnected collector host instance.

### Fixes

* Fix for [asynchronous jar file collection](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/20). Collection of modules will no longer block the initial first harvest.
* Fix for Real Time Streaming. The first Real Time Streaming harvest will no longer be delayed by 30 seconds.
* Fix for `reactor-netty` [verifier versions](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/15)
* Fix race condition around [connection pool exhaustion](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/25) by separating pool timeout from connection timeout.

### Note re: certificate bundle use_private_ssl

This release removed the certificate bundle from the agent artifact. Users previously using `use_private_ssl` should now use the `ca_bundle_path` [configuration directive](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file). For more information, see the [Java v6.0.0 release on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/releases/tag/v6.0.0).
