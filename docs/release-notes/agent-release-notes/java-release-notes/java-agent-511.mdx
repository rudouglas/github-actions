### Fixes

* gRPC

This release fixes two bugs in the Java agent's gRPC instrumentation. We highly recommend customers using gRPC instrumentation to upgrade to this and or later agent versions.

* References to transaction segments were not being removed correctly, which can cause a memory leak
* The agent could cause the gRPC server listeners to fail to execute its `completed` and/or `cancelled` methods, which can cause unexpected behavior
