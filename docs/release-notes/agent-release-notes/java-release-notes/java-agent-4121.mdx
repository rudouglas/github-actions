### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where an exception would be thrown during agent initialization which caused the application to shut down when the log file is not writable. In previous agent versions there was an undocumented behavior where the agent would log to STDOUT instead.
* Fixed a regression where a NullPointerException would be logged and instrumentation would not be applied when using an XML extension with comments preceding the instrumentation section.
* Fixed issue where setting the `log_limit_in_kbytes` greater than 0 and `log_file_count` equal to 1 would result in the agent not logging to the agent log file.
