### Improvements

* JAX-RS

  This release adds support for @PATCH JAX-RS annotation. The agent will create and name transactions based @PATCH annotations.

### Fixes

* Fixes an issue in the Scala instrumentation that would cause an `Java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:` to be thrown when the Lightbend Cinnamon agent is in use.
* Fixes an issue where [Cross Application Tracing headers](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/introduction-cross-application-traces) were incorrectly parsed when [Distributed Tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) is enabled. Applications that use both Distributed Tracing and Cross Application Tracing will no longer report external transaction breakdown metrics.
* Fixes an issue where the agentâ€™s Kafka instrumentation would report WakeupExceptions as errors in New Relic. These exceptions will no longer be reported.
* Fixes a Log4J ClassCastException for applications running on the IBM J9 JVM that set a custom logging manager via the `-Djava.util.logging.manager` system parameter.
* The agent now supports using the [thread profiler](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/thread-profiler-tool) when the [send_environment_info configuration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#cfg-send_environment_info) is disabled.

### Notes

* The agent now sends data to New Relic using gzip compression by default. To use the previous compression set the `compressed_content_encoding` configuration value to `deflate`
* The jdbc-resultset instrumentation is now disabled by default in the newrelic.yml and will be disabled by default in all future releases.

### Known Issues

Fixed in 5.1.1

* gRPC

This release contains two bugs in the Java agent's gRPC instrumentation. We highly recommend customers using gRPC instrumentation to upgrade to this and or later agent versions.

* References to transaction segments were not being removed correctly, which can cause a memory leak
* The agent could cause the gRPC server listeners to fail to execute its `completed` and/or `cancelled` methods, which can cause unexpected behavior
