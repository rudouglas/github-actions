### New Features

* **Support for Distributed tracing**

  Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.

  Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services.

  Refer to the New Relic [C SDK documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/enable-distributed-tracing-your-c-applications) for more information on enabling distributed tracing for the C SDK.

### End of Life Notice

* The `log_filename` and `log_level` fields of `newrelic_app_config_t` are currently deprecated. Future versions of the C SDK will permanently remove these fields. To specify the log file and log level to use with the C SDK, use `newrelic_configure_log()`.
