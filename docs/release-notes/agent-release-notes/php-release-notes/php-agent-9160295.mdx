### Bug fixes

* The Drupal instrumentation [now guards](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/73) against rare conditions that led to PHP processes exiting with an allocation error. Additionally, the allocation routines now log stack traces when they fail.
* When initially building the agent, a parallel build is [no longer required](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/69) to avoid an error about a missing header file (v1.pb-c.h).
* SOAP transactions when using Magento 2.3.2+ are [now properly named](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/76) instead of being attributed to Magento's internal SOAP interceptor. Thanks [@steven-hoffman-jomashop](https://github.com/steven-hoffman-jomashop) for the issue report and fix suggestion!

### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. As of this release, the oldest supported version is [8.5.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-850235).
