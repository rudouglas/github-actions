### New Features

* The PHP agent now has support for Doctrine 2 DQL Queries. When running a DQL query, it will appear alongside the SQL in both Slow SQLs and Transaction Traces.

### Notes

* The agent now includes attributes for HTTP response headers in web transactions:
  * `response.headers.contentType`
  * `response.headers.contentLength`

### Bug Fixes

* newrelic.transaction_events.enabled wasn't being observed. This has been fixed.
* The PHP in SUSE and OpenSUSE Linux was incompatible with some of the agent's features, including RUM and CAT. This issue has been fixed.
