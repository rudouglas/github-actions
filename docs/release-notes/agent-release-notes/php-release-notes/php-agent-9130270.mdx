### New Features

* Support has been added for Slim Framework 4.x.
* Support has been added for Laravel 7.x.

### Bug Fixes

* Users of `newrelic_record_datastore_segment` may have experienced situations where the total transaction time was higher than the response time. This was fixed and users will see behavior consistent with automatically created datastore segments.
* Previously, WordPress plugins referred to by their path names were not accounted for in caching. This behavior has been fixed, and users to which this applies to should see improvements in overhead.
