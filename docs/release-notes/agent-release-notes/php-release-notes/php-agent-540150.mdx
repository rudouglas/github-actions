### New Features

* Experimental support for instrumenting Guzzle has been added.

  We are very pleased to announce that we've added experimental support for instrumenting Guzzle 3, 4, 5, and 6. Requests made using Guzzle will now show up as externals in the same way as requests made using other instrumented libraries, like curl, `drupal_http_request()`, and `file_get_contents()`.

  To enable the experimental support, you will need to add a feature flag to your newrelic.ini: `newrelic.feature_flag = guzzle`. NOTE: We intend to enable the Guzzle support by default in a future release.

  More information can be found [on our Guzzle documentation page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/frameworks-libraries/guzzle).
