### New Features

* Support has been added for [Zend Framework 3](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements#frameworks).

### Bug Fixes

* The behavior of the installer when attempting to detect PHP installations has been tightened up. Previously, a directory structure such as `/usr/local/php/php/*` would be detected as an installation of PHP in `/usr/local/php`, as the nested `php` directory would be wrongly assumed to be a PHP CLI binary. The installer now checks if the nested `php` (or `php-config`) is a directory, and ignores the path if so.

  Although this is likely to improve the installer in multiple environments, most noticeably, this fix removes erroneous messages about there being multiple PHP installations when installing the PHP agent within the [Docker Hub's official PHP images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php).
* Spurious messages like `ALERT: oops, unknown child` could appear in the PHP FPM log when a New Relic daemon process was started. This has been fixed.
