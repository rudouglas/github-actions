### New Features

The [PHP agent](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent) is now open source!

The agent source code is available and open to contributions. You can now report issues and make feature requests for the agent directly on GitHub. See our [README](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

### Bug Fixes

* Under some circumstances, the agent reported a total time higher than the response time when using Zend_Http_Client. This has been fixed.
* The agent leaked a small amount of memory for each fulfilled Guzzle promise. This has been fixed.
* Calls to newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers could cause crashes on PHP 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2. This has been fixed.
* In rare cases, using Guzzle with WordPress and PHP 7.4 caused crashes. This has been fixed.
