### Notes

* A bug that could result in segfaults when transactions were restarted (either directly through `newrelic_start_transaction()` or indirectly through `newrelic_set_appname()`) was fixed.

  This also affected customers using Laravel Queue instrumentation, as this uses transaction restarts internally.
* PHPUnit may not have been detected on case sensitive filesystems on 9.0.0. This has been fixed.
* A bug that could result in segfaults for CodeIgniter applications on PHP 7 when `call_user_func_array()` inlining failed was fixed.

### Known issues and workarounds

* **Potential memory exhaustion for long running transactions.** See description under _Known issues and workarounds_ in the [PHP 9.0.0.242 release notes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-900242).
