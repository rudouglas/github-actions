### New Features

* Added support for New Relic Infinite Tracing. **Note:** the PHP agent does not yet support attributes on spans. This will be available in the next minor release.
* Added the following Infinite Tracing configuration options:
  * [newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-inftr-host)
  * [newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-inftr-port)
  * [newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-inftr-queue)
* Support for auto-instrumenting Symfony 5 applications has been added.
* Support for auto-instrumenting Drupal 9 applications has been added.

### Bug Fixes

* In some cases the `newrelic-daemon` got caught in an infinite loop on startup when the socket it tried to connect to was already acquired by another process. This behavior has been accounted for and fixed.
