### New Features

* **Support Laravel's handling of CORS HTTP OPTIONS.**  
  Requests for Laravel's built-in automatic handling of CORS HTTP OPTIONS requests will now be given the transaction name `_CORS_OPTIONS`.

### Bug Fixes

* A potential segfault when using PHP 7.3, opcache and multiple PHP workers has been fixed.
* Uncaught exceptions within a job being executed by a Laravel Queue worker are now reported correctly.
* Invoking [`function_exists()`](https://secure.php.net/function_exists) on a function disabled with the [`disable_functions`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.disable-functions) configuration directive will now correctly return `false`.
