### New Features

* **Support for Distributed tracing**

  Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.

  Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the [transition guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing) before you enable this feature.

  To enable distributed tracing, two parameters should be changed in the newrelic.ini file:

  ```
  newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true
  ```

  and

  ```
  newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0
  ```

  [Read more about about distributed tracing in the PHP Agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/features/distributed-tracing-php).

### Bug Fixes

* A bug in the PHP agent resulted in databaseCallCount attributes no longer being attached to Transaction events. The 8.4 release restores these attributes.
* Predis 2 cluster connections could not be instrumented due to internal changes in Predis. The 8.4 release fixes this.
