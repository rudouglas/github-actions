### New Features

* Support has been added for Magento 2.

### Bug Fixes

* Support for Laravel 5.2 has been added. Previously, Laravel 5.2 applications would fail to start with a `BadMethodCallException`. This was due to the agent's attempted use of a route filter for automatic transaction naming. Automatic transaction naming for Laravel 5.2 no longer relies on a route filter preventing the error. Automatic transaction naming for older versions of Laravel is unaffected.
* Calling `phpversion("newrelic")` could return `"unreleased"` instead of the actual version number. In turn, this caused `composer show --platform` to report a version of 0. This has been fixed. The version number reported by `phpinfo()` was not affected by this bug.
* Fixed a potential segfault when using `Zend_Http_Client` under PHP 5.5 or 5.6 with OPcache enabled.
