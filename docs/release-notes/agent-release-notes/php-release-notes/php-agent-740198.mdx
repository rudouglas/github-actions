### Bug Fixes

* On the first request served by a PHP process, a Drupal 6 or 7 hook that was invoked with `module_invoke()` before it had been invoked by `module_invoke_all()` could have its module name reported as an empty string. This has been fixed.
* On PHP 7.0 and 7.1, a Drupal 6 or 7 hook invoked via `module_invoke_all()` could report the module name as an empty string in some situations. This has been fixed.
