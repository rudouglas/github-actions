The Ruby agent can trace outgoing HTTP requests made by your application or script in order to:

* Record metrics about how long your HTTP requests are taking and which hosts they're hitting.
* Annotate transaction traces with nodes for each HTTP request.
* Provide [cross application tracing](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/cross-application-tracing-ruby) for requests between applications instrumented with New Relic.

## Supported HTTP client libraries [#supported_libraries]

The following HTTP client libraries are currently supported by the Ruby agent:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th width={200}>
        Minimum supported version
      </th>

      <th>
        Notes
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Net::HTTP
      </td>

      <td>
        N/A (part of the Ruby standard library)
      </td>

      <td>
        Also includes libraries built upon Net::HTTP, such as [httparty](http://johnnunemaker.com/httparty/).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [Excon](https://github.com/geemus/excon)
      </td>

      <td>
        0.10.1

    </tr>

    <tr>

        [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus)
      </td>

      <td>
        0.5.3
      </td>

      <td>
        Hydra requests get partial instrumentation, 1.8.7 stability. See [Typhoeus notes](#typhoeus).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [HTTPClient](https://github.com/nahi/httpclient)
      </td>

      <td>
        2.2.0
      </td>

      <td>
        Instrumentation of asynchronous requests is not supported.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

        [Curb](https://github.com/taf2/curb)

        Curl::Multi requests get partial instrumentation. See [Curb notes](#curb).

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [http.rb](https://github.com/httprb/http)
      </td>

        0.9.9
      </td>

      <td/>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Excon notes [#excon]

The Ruby agent supports Excon version **0.10.1 or higher.** Excon instrumentation for Excon versions 0.19.0 and up relies on the ability to add an Excon middleware to the `:middlewares` key of `Excon.defaults`, so if your application modifies `Excon.defaults` you should ensure that you preserve the value of the `:middlewares` key.

## Typhoeus notes [#typhoeus]

The Ruby agent supports Typhoeus version **0.5.3 or higher**.

Parallel requests made via the `Hydra` mechanism in Typhoeus currently only have partial tracing support. For such requests, the Ruby agent will record a single transaction trace node representing the entire batch, but you will not be able to see the details about each individual request in the batch. Requests made via the `Hydra` mechanism will also not get cross application tracing support.

Testing has shown significant issues with segfaults when running Typhoeus on MRI 1.8.7.  
**Recommendation:** Use Ruby Enterprise Edition or MRI 1.9.3 or higher to avoid these problems.

## Curb notes [#curb]

The Ruby agent supports Curb version **0.8.1 or higher.** Curb instrumentation on JRuby is **not** supported.

Requests made via the `Curl::Multi` API currently only have partial tracing support (equivalent to what is offered for requests made via the Typhoeus `Hydra` API). For such requests, the Ruby agent will record a single transaction trace node representing the entire batch, but you will not be able to see the details about each individual request in the batch. Requests made via the `Curl::Multi` mechanism will also not get cross application tracing support.
