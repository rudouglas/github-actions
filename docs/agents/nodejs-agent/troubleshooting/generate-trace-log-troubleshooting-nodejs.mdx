Your New Relic [Node.js agent log](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#logging_config) captures errors at the default `info` level. However, when troubleshooting or debugging, generate a more verbose `trace` log to help find and investigate problems.

<Callout variant="important">
  The `trace` log setting is a highly verbose logging level. To reduce disk space consumption, return the `logging : {` section's `level` to its [original setting](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#logging_config) after testing.
</Callout>

## Generate log files [#create]

To generate the detailed `trace` log file:

1. Edit your `newrelic.js` file and change the `logging` section's `level` to `trace`.

   ```
   logging: {
       level: 'trace'
     }
   ```
2. Restart Node.
3. Exercise your web application for about five minutes to generate sufficient logging data.
4. After testing, change the `level` to a less verbose [logging level](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#log_level), such as `info` (default).
5. Open and examine the generated log file.

## Examine log file [#logfile]

By default, the Node.js agent [stores the log file](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#log) in the current working directory as `newrelic_agent.log`. If the log file or folder are not visible:

1. Check whether you have set the logging path to `stdout` or `stderr`.
2. Verify that the current working directory is the same as the directory where you expect the log file to be located.
