This documentation contains requirements and tips for integrating the Python agent with an app that uses Waitress. To return to the general install instructions, go to [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).

The Python agent provides support for the [Waitress](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/waitress) WSGI server. This includes automatically instrumenting the WSGI application entry point supplied to the Waitress server. The automatic instrumentation will work if the `waitress.serve()` API function is used directly, or if `egg:waitress#main` is specified as the server to use when starting up the web application using PasteDeploy.

## Admin script integration method [#integrated-server]

You can use the recommended admin script integration method, as described in the general [installation documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integrate-with-application).

## Using PasteDeploy

If rather than manually integrating the call to startup the Waitress WSGI server in your application code, you are using PasteDeploy with a configuration similar to:

```
[server:main]
use = egg:waitress#main
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
```

all you instead need to do to start up your WSGI application is wrap the running of the `paster` command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
```
