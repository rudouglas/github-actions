You can filter your [New Relic One dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use.

## Why use facet filtering? [#feature]

In [New Relic One dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), for NRQL queries containing a [`FACET` clause](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet) and meeting other [chart-type requirements](#requirements), you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use.

This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard.

To see this feature in action, see the [example use case](#example-use).

## Requirements

Requirements to use this feature:

* Must be in [New Relic One dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards). Will not work on a standalone chart in the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).
* NRQL query must contain a [`FACET` clause](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet).
* Available only for [bar charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-barchart), [heat maps](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-heatmap), [pie charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-piechart), and [tables](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table).

## Example use of facet filtering [#example-use]

Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One:

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: For queries containing a `FACET` clause and meeting [chart-type requirements](#requirements), you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select.
</figcaption>

If you select **Filter the current dashboard**, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available `userAgentName` attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top.

For more about this feature, see the [Explorers Hub post on facet filtering](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/facet-linking-in-new-relic-one-now-you-can-use-facets-to-filter-your-new-relic-one-dashboards/82289).

## Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause [#facet-linking-cases]

[`FACET CASES`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-facet-cases) is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet.

For example, let's say you query your applications, but you don't know which have been migrated to cloud and which haven't.

```
SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'On-premises', filter(count(*), 
WHERE duration < .06) as 'AWS' 
FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago
```

![facet_cases_01.png](./images/facet_cases_01.png "facet_cases_01.png")

By using FACET cases, you can add the condition and obtain the status of the migration:

```
SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' 
facet cases(WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' OR appName = 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts On-Prem', 
WHERE appName != 'WebPortal' 
AND appName != 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts in Cloud') 
since 10 minutes ago limit 100
```

Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.
