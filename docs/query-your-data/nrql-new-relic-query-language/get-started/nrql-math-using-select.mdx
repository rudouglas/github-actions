New Relic Query Language (NRQL) supports basic math functions within a `SELECT` clause. You can apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on both individual attributes as well as the results of aggregator functions.

## Use math operators with SELECT [#math]

To use basic math functions in NRQL, include operators within the `SELECT` clause:

* Addition: `+`
* Subtraction: `-`
* Multiplication: `*`
* Division: `/`

Here are some examples:

```
SELECT duration-databaseDuration FROM Transaction
```

```
SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView
```

```
SELECT average(duration-databaseDuration) FROM Transaction
```

## Results with STRING or FLOAT [#strings]

Here is how NRQL handles strings present in math calculations:

Examples:

* `sum(1+STRING)` = 0
* `sum(1+MIXED)` = skips records where MIXED is a string
* `average(1+STRING)` = 0
* `average(1+MIXED)` = skips records where MIXED is a string

NULL and zero both appear as 0 in the dashboard.

To override NULL values with another numeric value, use the syntax:

```
SELECT average(purchasePrice OR 0)
```

This will replace NULL values with 0 or any number specified.

  This can also be used to test whether something returns NULL or zero. `(zero) OR 1` returns 0. `(NULL) OR 1` returns 1.
</Callout>

## Advanced math functions

NRQL includes advanced mathematical functions that can be used for complex calculations and for processing data to display more effectively in the UI.

### `abs`

`abs(n)` returns the absolute value of _n_. For non-negative _n_ it returns _n_, and for negative _n_ it returns the positive number -_n_. For example `abs(2) = 2`, and `abs(-4) = 4`.

### `round`, `floor`, `ceil`(ing)

These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers.

* `floor(n)` returns the closest integer less than or equal to _n_.
* `ceil(n)` returns the closest integer greater than or equal to _n_.
* `round(n)` returns the closest integer to _n_ in either direction.

### `clamp_max`, `clamp_min`

The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values.

For example, `clamp_max(duration, 10)` returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned.

Similarly `clamp_min(duration, 1)` will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90.

### `pow`

`pow(n, m)` computes _n_ raised to the power _m_. (I.e. `n * n * ... * n,` with _m_ copies of _n_)

### `sqrt`

`sqrt(n)` returns the square root of _n_, that is, the number such that `sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n.`

### `exp`

Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: `exp(n) = pow(e, n)`.

### `ln, log2, log10, log`

These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases.

* `ln(n)` computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e.
* `log2(n)` computes the logarithm base 2.
* `log10(n)` computes the logarithm base 10.
* `log(n, b)` allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b.
* All logarithms satisfy the identity: `log(pow(b, n), b) = n.`

Note that `log(0`) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting "No Value" back from your query.
